      "  official sources have reported that several guerrilla attacks and heavy fighting took place the evening of 9 january and this morning throughout the country, and as a result, three soldiers were killed and three others injured.    alleged guerrilla urban commandos launched two highpower bombs against a car dealership in downtown san salvador this morning.  a police report said that the attack set the building on fire, but did not result in any casualties although economic losses are heavy.    during the evening of 9 january, guerrilla urban commandos bombed two electricity facilities in different places in san salvador, which caused power outages in some areas of the capital.    meanwhile, the armed forces press committee (coprefa) reported today that three army soldiers were killed recently in clashes against members of the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) in different parts of the central and eastern regions of the country.    the war bulletin by coprefa stated that the clashes, in which three members of the general juan ramon belloso battalion were injured, took place in san jose guayabal, in the central cuscatlan department, and in santa elena in the eastern usulutan department.\n",

      "  two bomb attacks were carried out in la paz last night, one in front of government house following the message to the nation over a radio and television network by president jaime paz zamora.    the explosions did not cause any serious damage but the police were mobilized, fearing a wave of attacks.    the self-styled \"zarate willka liberation armed forces\" sent simultaneous written messages to the media, calling on the people to oppose the government, which it says is \"at the service of the wealthy and the exploiters.\"  it also calls for free education, the establishment of permanent jobs, the defense of coca-leaf farming, and the defense against u.s. intervention and big land owners.    the first bomb attack occurred at 2230 (0230 gmt on 12 january) in front of the planning and economic coordination ministry, just before president paz zamora concluded his message to the nation in which he explained the guidelines of the general economic program that the government will implement between 1990 and 1993.    roberto barbery, interior ministry intelligence department director, has reported that dynamite sticks were hurled from a car.    the second attack occurred at 2335 (0335 gmt on 12 january), just after the cabinet members had left government house where they had listened to the presidential message.    a bomb was placed outside government house in the parking lot that is used by cabinet ministers.  the police placed the bomb in a nearby flower bed, where it went off.  the shock wave shattered some windows in government house and street lamps in the plaza murillo.    as of 0500 gmt today, the police had received reports of two other explosions in two la paz neighborhoods, but these have not yet been confirmed.

      "  what we had predicted has occurred.  cristiani announced this afternoon that a colonel, two lieutenants, one second lieutenant, two second sergeants, and two soldiers were involved in the massacre of the jesuits.    the accusation against colonel benavides is the following: that the multiple crime was committed in the sector under his command.  from the lieutenant on down, the accusation is that they directly participated in the crime.  (words indistinct), as cristiani said, that it was col benavides, but it was not col benavides who issued the order.  so, the question is: who gave the order to kill the jesuits and their two maids.  in our view, col benavides was implicated solely as a means of propaganda aimed at the u.s. congress.  it is clear that col benavides did not give the order.  he probably did not even know about the action.  this is consistent with what we know about his background.  first, he is not known to have carried out acts of repression or corruption.  our report indicates that benavides has    maintained a position in favor of institutions and open to discussions. he was described as an active, studious and not repressive cadet, one of the few exceptions in la tandona (reference to the 1977 graduating class of the captain general gerardo barrios military academy).  in other words, for the la tandona, a gang of assassins, he is a perfect scapegoat.    the massacre of the jesuits was not a personal decision.  it was part of the armed forces' counteroffensive actions during the november battles.  it was a cold-blooded, premeditated plan executed to decapitate the people's movement and the democratic opposition.  let us remember the threats against father ellacuria over the national radio network prior to the assassination.  let us remember that between the night of 15 november and early morning of 16 november, several offices of labor unions and houses of opposition members were attacked.  let us remember that after the masssacre of the jesuits, the officers shouted over loudspeakers that they had killed ellacuria and that they were going to continue killing communists.  the bishop of san salvador was a witness to this.    in our view, the assassins of the jesuits were those who appeared on the radio and television network making known the results of the so-called honor commission.  col benavides will probably be freed in a short time and be appointed to some post abroad, or he might experience the same fate as that of captain eduardo alfonso avila, who went in and out of jail each time that military aid for el salvador was discussed in the u.s. congress.    however, in any case and as has always occurred, it will be the lieutenants, the noncommissioned officers, and the soldiers who carried out an order who will pay the consequences.  we have already seen this happen in the cases of the nuns when (words indistinct) a few soldiers, the massacre of san francisco, and the assassination of the u.s. advisers and rodolfo viera.  (words indistinct) once again the people's hopes are frustrated, as has happened in so many other cases.    the assassination of the jesuits again confirms that to, as cristiani said, get to the bottom of this, we have to obtain democracy, justice, and self-determination.\n",

      "  armando calderon sol, president of the nationalist republican alliance (arena), the ruling salvadoran party, today called for an investigation into any possible connection between the military personnel implicated in the assassination of jesuit priests and the salvadoran guerrillas.    \"it is something so horrendous, so monstrous, that we must investigate the possibility that the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) staged this assassination to discredit the government,\" calderon sol said.    salvadoran president alfredo cristiani implicated four officers, including one colonel, and five members of the armed forces in the assassination of six jesuit priests and two women on 16 november at the central american university.    according to calderon sol, the salvadoran government \"is dutybound to uncover the murderers of the jesuits and to see if there is any link between the soldiers involved and the fmln.\"    \"those responsible acted on their own, to cause problems for the cristiani government and discredit it.  it could not possibly be an isolated act. investigations are pointing to some kind of conspiracy,\" the president of the rightist arena party said.    in addition, calderon sol asked the governments of el salvador and guatemala to carry out an \"exhaustive\" investigation to ensure that the murder of social democratic leader hector oqueli colindres \"does not go unpunished.\"    calderon noted that \"oqueli had clearly renounced the position of armed struggle in favor of a program for democratic participation.\"    oqueli colindres, a salvadoran leader of the socialist international, was found dead along with gilda flores, a member of the guatemalan social democratic party, on 13 january in a town in southeastern guatemala near the salvadoran border.\n",

      "  salvadoran president alfredo cristiani today postponed his trip to the united states, which was scheduled for 16-23 january, until later this month, according to an announcement today by information secretary mauricio sandoval.    the presidential spokesman explained that the postponement of cristiani's trip is due to the president's interest in meeting with un secretary general javier perez de cuellar to request that perez de cuellar act as mediator to achieve the resumption of dialogue with the salvadoran guerrillas.    \"we have received information from new york to the effect that perez de cuellar will not be available on the dates initially set for the trip, thus, cristiani's visit has been postponed, sandoval said.    according to sandoval, cristiani will meet with perez de cuellar on 31 january, after which he will go to washington in early february to meet with u.s. president george bush.    sandoval denied that the postponement of cristiani's trip is related to possible reaction to the arrest of eight members of the army, including four officers, on charges of being implicated in the murder of six jesuit priests and two employees.    \"there is no relation, because the case of the jesuits is being resolved,\" the spokesman said.    sandoval also denied that postponement of the trip is linked to the assassination of hector oqueli, a salvadoran leader of the socialist international, 3 days ago in guatemala.    after learning of oqueli's assassination, the guerrillas announced that they will \"revise\" their offer to resume the dialogue with the government. however, the presidential spokesman indicated that the guerrillas have sent no official note explaining the revision.\n",

      "  the public security forces (fusep) have declared a state of maximum alert throughout the country in view of the possibility of subversive attacks on police stations, a spokesman for that institution has reported.    the alert status has been in effect since last thursday, when fusep staff commander colonel cristobal simon romerro sent notice to commanders and regional and subregional posts alerting them about the danger of leftist attacks.    a police spokesman has said the fusep has intelligence information on leftist plans to attack police stations.    the source reported that a state of maximum alert will be in effect until further notice, adding that the police have strategic plans to respond to any attacks.    there is no report on whether or not the army is also on a state of alert.  yesterday, people were able to move about as usual in southern tegucigalpa, where some army combat units are headquartered.    the police department declared the state of alert as a result of a wave of violence that began with the killing of three people in january.    nicaraguan contra commander manuel adan rugama, alias aureliano, was shot to death in northern tegucigalpa on 7 january, and attorney carlos lorenzana, who defended juan ramon matta in honduras, was shot to death near his residence in the modelo neighborhood by unidentified assailants. none of these crimes has been solved by the police.    on 25 january, alleged commandos of the \"cinchonero\" people's liberation front machinegunned retired general gustavo alvarez martinez, a former armed forces commander.  alvarez martinez was killed near his residence in tegucigalpa's florencia del este neighborhood.  the following sunday the residence of the nicaraguan ambassador in this capital was attacked.    this past wednesday unidentified people fired on a u.s. military convoy in yoro department.  military sources have reported that special troops are combing the area.\n",

      "  the salvadoran guerrillas today threatened to murder individuals involved in the 19 march presidential elections if they do not resign from their posts.    \"all individuals and institutions involved in the 19 march electoral farce will be mercilessly punished by the people's justice for contributing to the continuation of the war,\" the guerrillas warned today in a message broadcast by radio venceremos, their official radio station.    the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) is opposed to the presidential elections and has asked the people not to vote or to destroy their ballots.    the guerrilla threat is aimed at members of the departmental and municipal ballot-receiving boards, mayors, judges, party directorates, and electoral college officials.    the warning also applies to the owners of vehicles that operate during an idefinite transportation strike the fmln is scheduled to initiate on 16 march at 0000.    swearing in approximately 20 ballot-receiving boards in san salvador, ricardo perdomo, president of the central electoral council, said the armed forces and the council are prepared to guarantee normal elections.    \"we were expecting this.  we know the guerrillas will implement all types of boycotts to hinder the elections.  nevertheless, we are in a position to guarantee the elections,\" perdomo reiterated.    military units have been deployed since yesterday in cities in the eastern departments of morazan, san miguel, usulutan, and la union, where the rebels persistently sabotage the electrical system.    the fmln has announced it will intensify its \"insurrectional actions\" throughout the country, which could affect the nation's electrical and telephone systems on election day.    the guerrillas are opposed to the elections because they feel they are \"part of the counterinsurgency plan and a means of legitimizing the continuation of war, hunger, and poverty.\"    \"those who cooperate with the electoral farce will be thrown out of their homes, executed, and their properties will be sabotaged before, during, and after the elections,\" the rebels said.    the guerrillas sent messages on saturday night to the mayors and municipal councils of eight towns in la union department, demanding that they resign or the fmln will \"bring to bear\" against them \"the entire weight of popular justice.\"\n",

      "  the nicaraguan foreign ministry has denied the charges that the honduran government has leveled against the nicaraguan embassy in tegucigalpa regarding the 7 january assassination in tegucigalpa of manuel rugama, known as commander aureliano, the second in command of the counterrevolutionaries in honduras.    honduran national police on monday presented to the press honduran juan bautista nunez amador and nicaraguan luis fernando ordonez reyes, who told reporters that commander aureliano was assassinated on orders from jose de jesus pena, the nicaraguan embassy chief of security.    mercedes borge, press director at the nicaraguan foreign ministry, said there is no jose de jesus pena employed at the nicaraguan embassy in tegucigalpa and that aureliano's assassination was perpetrated by three individuals and not two, as the honduran police claim.  borge said that while nicaragua makes serious and formal proposals to advance peace efforts, it is worrisome that honduran military personnel are creating situations that could unleash conflicts between the two countries.  there have already been two attacks on the nicaraguan embassy in tegucigalpa, borge said.  she added that the honduran police report conflicts with the autopsy report, because in his statement, nunez amador referred to only a .38-caliber revolver and a .45-caliber pistol, which were not found on rugama's body or in his vehicle.\n",

      "  what began as a search for a weapons cache became a mystery that would rival any of sherlock holmes' stories.  in a house located 1 km from tenjo, north of bogota, 13th brigade members today found a grave containing the bodies of two women who were buried more than 3 months ago.    the house was rented in 1987 by luis emilio espina, also known as gonzalo rojas, who was killed 1 week ago.  sources in the 13th brigade link him and his loan guarantor, ernesto velez, who was killed on the guaymaral highway 6 weeks ago, to the medellin cartel.    the house is on the peru farm, which adjoins the chiguachi estate belonging to gonzalo rodriguez gacha and camilo zapata, who also owns the famous marroquin castle.    according to a high-ranking infantry school officer, this is the same house where (bogota mayor) andres pastrana was held when he was kidnapped.  the person leasing the property disappeared after the assassination of luis carlos galan, and since then 10 other people who used to frequent the farm have been mysteriously killed.\n",

      "  on the eve of presidential elections, more than 80 percent of public transportation in san salvador is paralyzed while a majority of the residents are not receiving potable water or electric power.    reports arriving this morning from the outskirts of the capital, state that cities such as mejicanos, san marcos, apopa, isustepeque, and delgado, among others, have not received basic public services for the past 3 days.    the national police this morning reported that public transportation in san salvador has been more than 80 percent halted for the 3d day in a row and only certain minibuses and light cargo vehicles are serving certain routes.    workers at the eastern and western bus terminals of this capital report that the transportation situation is similar to yesterday's.  no buses have arrived or departed san salvador for the country's 13 departments.    much central american commercial transportation is also paralyzed by the transportation stoppage in el salvador since many railroad boxcars are being held up at the salvadoran borders unable to enter the national territory.    meanwhile, at least two bombs placed near electric power poles were detonated this morning in san salvador.  one was placed at 16 west street in the ivu neighborhood, in the southern area of the capital, and a fragmentation grenade exploded near the santa isabel neighborhood.  a telephone junction box, the exact location of which has not yet been determined, was also destroyed.    military security has been stepped up throughout this capital and its outskirts only 24 hours before presidential elections.  official sources this morning reported that armed forces troops are mainly patroling san salvador gas stations, since farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) urban commands have threatened to destroy them.    it was also reported that salvadoran air force helicopters are overflying the capital to protect vehicles that are transitting the main streets of san salvador, despite the transportation stoppage decreed by the insurgency 3 days ago.  reports also state that the national and treasury police are offering free transportation to people heading for their respective work places.    the army is using loudspeakers on military vehicles to urge the people to vote in presidential elections tomorrow.  for sunday's elections, the army will deploy a large number of units to transport voters, who will be going to their respective polling places throughout the country.    in the salvadoran capital, police-military security has been stepped up less than 24 before the 1989 presidential elections.  we have noticed a larger number of security personnel near the seven voting centers the central electoral council has set up in san salvador municipality.      in the outlying cities of northern san salvador, such as mexicanos, cuscatancingo, and apopa, transportation is still completely paralyzed in the wake of the ground transportation stoppage decreed by the fmln, which is in its 3d day today.    meanwhile, reports from chalatenango, 72 km north of san salvador, state that the entire department is without electricity due to rationing that the cel (lempa river hydroelectric executive commission) has imposed on the entire country after fmln guerrillas carried out large-scale sabotage operations against the electricity network early this week.    military sources consulted this morning in chalatenango said that there have been no clashes between military forces and guerrillas in that area for the past few hours.  these sources said that the voting booths that will be installed in 33 municipalities of that northern department are ready.  they added that the number of military units in that area of the country has been increased.\n",

      "  the salvadoran army accepted responsibility this morning for the death of two reporters who were shot by soldiers in the past few hours in the capital and in the eastern san miguel department.    according to the official report, in both cases, the soldiers fired when the reporters, both salvadorans, ignored orders to halt.  however, friends of the victims maintain this is not true.    a spokesman for the army press committee said that last night, an air force member fired at photographers roberto navas and luis galdamez, salvadorans who work for the british reuter news agency, \"when they failed to stop at a military checkpoint\" at a capital city avenue.    navas died and galdamez was seriously injured.  galdamez was left lying in the street until he was picked up \"several hours later,\" by his own account, and taken to a hospital, where he underwent surgery.    according to hospital sources and reuter, galdamez is now \"out of danger;\" it will not be necessary to amputate his right arm, as was originally feared.    another reporter, mauricio pineda, a sound technician for canal doce television of san salvador, died this morning in the eastern part of the country at a crossroads, when a soldier fired at pineda's vehicle while he was on his way to cover today's elections.    the army spokesman emphasized that in both cases, \"the soldiers fired on suspicious-looking people who did not respect the stop sign at a military checkpoint.\"    however, galdamez said he and navas, who were on a motocycle, did stop at the checkpoint and that the soldiers fired on them without justification.    raul beltran, one of mauricio pineda's coworkers, said the canal doce team was traveling in a station wagon with white flags and signs indicating they were reporters and that the soldiers fired without having first given any indication the reporters should stop.\n",

      "  after a 1st hour in which there was a very small turnout at the polls, the number of salvadorans going to vote in the capital city and other towns is increasing. thousands of voters were standing in lines at mid-morning.    army and police units surround the polls while military helicopters continue to fly over the city.    fidel chavez mena of the ruling christian democratic party (pdc) told the press he has received reports from his followers throughout the country to the effect that 95 percent of the polls have been installed and are operating, after overcoming some early morning problems in some of the places.    the polls opened at 0700 (1300 gmt) and will close at 1700 (2300 gmt).    the bomb explosions and shooting heard throughout the early hours in san salvador were no longer heard after 1000 (1600 gmt).      however, attacks against vehicles and clashes between the guerrillas and the army continue to be reported in various parts of country's interior.    the guerrillas continue to boycott the elections with a blockade of all land transportation, but they have announced they will not directly attack the voters or the polling stations.    highway checkpoint soldiers killed two salvadoran reporters, roberto navas and mauricio pineda, in two separate shootings late last night and early this morning.  navas was a photographer from an international news agency, and pineda was a sound technician for a local television channel.    prominent among the electors, both in the capital and in neighboring towns, are many members of the main opposition party, the rightist nationalist republican alliance (arena), who are carrying banners and other visible signs of their party preference.    surveys have shown arena's candidate, alfredo cristiani, will almost certainly win the elections.    acan-efe correspondents who toured voting booths in the capital and other towns saw soldiers and policemen carefully checking all voters before allowing them to enter the voting areas.    voters who arrive in automobiles have to leave them more than 200 meters away.    in apopa, a town some 12 km north of san salvador, the voting booths opened very late, because their location was changed at the last minute, which generated protests from the delegates of several parties and led to brawls between arena and pdc supporters.    in the early morning, military helicopters used flares several times to light up apopa and its environs, presumably to locate guerrillas.    members of the democratic convergence, an alliance of leftist parties, said in apopa they have received death threats to dissuade them from voting.    in the small town of tonacatepeque, some 16 km northeast of san salvador, the delay in beginning the voting was only half an hour long, and the election process is proceeding normally.     in san ramon, another town close to the capital with 30,000 inhabitants, the voting began after a considerable dealy because of a guerrilla incursion in the dawn hours.    army helicopters fired rockets for several hours at the slopes of san salvador volcano, in the northern part of the capital, presumably at the guerrilla columns that attacked san ramon.\n",

(reporter) what can the government do about the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front)?    (ponce) we can ask them to join the country's democratic, civic life to (words indistinct) people to live in peace.    (reporter) how do you view the voting situation and the security and surveillance the armed forces is providing, especially now that the armed forces are being charged with the death of two journalists?  i think you are aware of that.  tell us something about that.    (ponce) we are the first ones to regret the death of the canal doce newsmen who died in san miguel and the reuter correspondent who died here on army boulevard.  those deaths are the result of the prevailing unrest and nervousness.  there are bullets being fired all over the place and, unfortunately, those reporters were the first to get hit.  this continues to be a problem that the armed forces has (words indistinct).    (reporter) did the army suffer casualties during the incidents in san ramon?    (ponce) i can tell you that a bracamonte battalion corporal died and another soldier was wounded.  however, the 1st infantry brigade and bracamonte battalion soldiers reacted quickly and repelled the terrorist activity that is currently causing chaos in san salvador.      (reporter) have other incidents been reported?    (ponce) it is difficult to believe what the fmln is saying. their spokesman in mexico city said they would not attack the voting tables. however, we have heard that voting tables have been attacked in 15 areas of the country.  attacks on voting tables were reported in chalatenango, san antonio, ciudad barrios, carolina, and north (word indistinct).  in usulutan, the fmln planted two bombs just outside the city to frighten the people.  however, our people's democratic nature is telling the fmln:  we do not want terrorism, we want peace, and we are using peaceful means to achieve power and choose our president and vice president.    (reporter) how is the voting process progressing throughout the country?    (ponce) there are 27 municipalities where elections are not being held. we know for sure that there are municipalities, like cinquera and arambala, where (words indistinct), and we also know that (words indistinct).  we know there are 27 municipalities where there will be no voting and there are others that (words indistinct) that the representatives of the political parties and members of the municipal voting table boards (words indistinct).    (reporter) how many soldiers are protecting the voting table boards throughout the country?    (ponce) about 80 percent of our soldiers are part of the democracy plan. we are going to continue offering the same protection after the voting centers are closed (words indistinct).    (reporter) we have read some reports that the armed forces are urging the people to vote for the christian democratic party (pdc).  will the soldiers be allowed to vote?    (ponce) first, i emphatically and categorically deny that we are urging the people to vote for the pdc.  we have sent a memorandum to all the commanders and (word indistinct) chiefs advising them that we must have a completely apolitical attitude and refrain from participating in any political activity.  we must protect all political parties, we must protect all the voting centers, and we must ensure the safety of the areas surrounding the voting centers.  we are not interested in who wins the elections; we are interested in making sure that the will of the people is respected and (words indistinct).  this is a day for the salvadoran people to prove their democratic nature.    (reporter) will soldiers be allowed to cast their votes today?    (ponce) as soldiers we all have the right to vote.  but before we cast our vote we are going to fulfill our duty.  our duty is to guarantee safety.  this will not create a problem.  for example, if a soldier's identification card was issued in san salvador but he is stationed in aguilares, he will be allowed to vote at a specific voting center.  those who can vote will do so as civilians and they will be unarmed.  (words indistinct) mostly administrative personnel and (word indistinct).    (reporter) (words indistinct) the rebels have threatened to launch a large attack.  do you have enough men to fight them at this time?

      "  jose ricardo perdomo, chairman of the central electoral council of el salvador, announced the end of the presidential elections in the country in a telephone interview with tass.  the counting of votes in sunday's election in the presence of foreign observers was in progress, and preliminary results would be declared later on monday.  political observers believe that alfredo cristiani, candidate of the right-wing nationalist republican alliance, has won.    staff members of the (central electoral) council noted in an interview with (tass) that voting began slowly in the morning.  a total of 1,835,000 voters were registered in the country with a population of five million. according to estimates of journalists in san salvador, the percentage of salvadoreans who abstained from voting was higher this time than at the 1984 presidential election which was won by jose napoleon duarte, candidate of the christian democratic party.    constant armed clashes between detachments of the farabundo marti national liberation front and army units interfered with the presidential election.  on the eve of the election, the insurgent radio stations (venceremos and farabundo) marti broadcast reports that guerillas would not attack polling stations.  insurgents attacked military garrisons in morer than 20 inhabited localities throughout the country on sunday, putting out of action some 150 government troops.  guerillas also downed a helicopter gunship in usulutan region.  as a result of insurgent actions, a considerable part of the country remains without electricity or telephone communication.  the insurgent operation to block highways and railways continues.    (vides) casanova, salvadorean minister of defence and public security, admitted that the election did not take place in 29 out of 262 districts in the country due to the fact that the army could not restore control over those territories.    apart from motor vehicles with troops and military partols, only taxis with journalists covering the voting drove in san salvador on the election day.  press cars had white handkerchiefs fixed to aerials.  this precaution was taken after military patrols killed three journalists:  robnerto navas, a reuter news photographer, coronel lagrow, a dutch tv correspondent, and mauricio pineda, a staff member of salvadorean television.  luis galdamez, another reuter correspondent, was seriously wounded, and his arm will probably have to be amputated.\n",

      "  orlando quiteno, spokesman of the lempa river hydroelectric executive commission, has reported that in the past few hours, the salvadoran guerrillas destroyed at least 10 power transmission towers, damaging seven high voltage lines in the northern and central parts of the country. quiteno said that the new sabotage caused a 25-percent energy loss in san salvador.  the damage to the energy system caused traffic jams in san salvador and a virtual paralysis in activities because of energy rationing.    the resumption of the sabotage against the energy system is accompanied by the resumption of rebel attacks against brothels, two of which were destroyed in the last 24 hours, although no casualties have been reported. the brothels reportedly have been attacked because it is believed that women are exploited there.  in addition, urban guerrillas blew up a public bus in a neighborhood located north of san salvador; no casualties have been reported.\n",

      "  the honduran armed forces intelligence corps yesterday thwarted \"operation summer 89,\" which was a sandinist people's army (eps) plan to sabotage and pillage towns on the honduras-nicaragua border.    a military source made this announcement, adding that 15 days ago, an eps battalion stationed in somoto was deployed to the eastern part of honduras, and enroute they were joined by 300 men who were instructed to wear u.s. army and contra uniforms.    according to the source, of the 300 men, 50 entered honduran towns, among them alauca, samayares, oropoli, and santa maria, where they carried out sabotage and pillage in the hope that residents would blame the contras and retaliate against them.    moreover, he added, five men had the audacity to enter the 6th infantry batallion's positions in ojo de agua to make a sketch of the 110th infantry brigade batallion's exact location and establish the actual location of honduran troops in that sector.      the source said the sandinists who entered honduran territory used booby traps to carry out their actions, and were equipped with assault weapons, rpg's, and ak-47 machineguns.      to conclude, the source said \"operation summer 89\" was scheduled to begin yesterday, 30 march, but the armed forces are constantly on alert to avoid any wrongful actions and to guarantee national integrity and sovereignty.\n",

      "  political life in colombia is still linked with violence.....    (cepeda) colombia is experiencing an extremely severe political and institutional crisis, caused by the incompatibility between the fast developing productive forces and the existing political setup.  for example, last year colombia's economic growth was 4.5 percent.  however, political life continues to be dominated by the two old parties -- the liberals and the conservatives, who maintain a merely formal democracy.  we should not forget colombia's strategic position:  it forms a bridge between central and south america.  all events in colombia affect the neighboring countries.      precisely because of this, the so-called \"santa fe-2\" document, drawn up by extreme right-wing u.s. politicians, contains a plan to apply pressure in colombia and, more specifically, to expand the so-called low-intensity conflict, one of whose manifestations is the so-called \"dirty war\" in the country.    accordingly, the violence in colombia is caused by both internal factors -- the crisis of the institutions -- and external ones, namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the united states.    (sertov) can one expect the peace settlement to be fulfilled under these conditions?    (cepeda) this is the aim of the communist party of colombia (pcc).  at our recent 15th congress, we made a detailed analysis of the situation and concluded that the conflict in colombia must be settled by political means. the pcc raised the question of removing the siege situation that, with a few interruptions, has been maintained for several decades, and of disbanding the paramilitary groups (according to the minister of internal affairs, about 140 such groups are operating).  these groups owe their very existence to the support given by military circles and the clan chiefs to the trade in narcotics.  (i will add in parentheses that this is the reason for the use of the term \"narcomilitarism\" in colombia.) one of the pcc's demands is that the army should be purged of fascist elements and that a civilian should be put in charge of the ministry of defense.  the party also raised the question of making a start on the necessary democratic reforms, but the government pays no heed to our demands.    the government recently reached an agreement with \"m-19,\" one of the partisan groupings in the country, but did not accept any commitments in practice.  accordingly, there are some doubts over how the lives of the partisan leaders will be subsequently guaranteed.  the largest partisan group -- the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -- is demanding that the government take serious steps to limit the paramilitary groups, in order to conclude a truce.    (sertov) clearly, it will not be easy to achieve peace in colombia.    (cepeda) at the moment, peace supporters in colombia are forming  a broad front, which in practice has an antifascist orientation.  peace depends on how far this front will succeed in expanding, how the contradictions within the government itself regarding the paramilitary groups will deepen, and on whether we will succeed in isolating them.  we are optimists, but also have a great need of international solidarity.    (sertov) how do you assess the political prospects for the united left in your country?    (cepeda) the left forces in colombia are united in the patriotic union that was created 4 years ago.  its aim is to achieve national reconciliation in our country.  however, the union immediately became a target of the organizers of the \"dirty war.\" hundreds of its leaders were beaten up, many of whom were pcc members.  so far, over 1,000 people have died, including jaime pardo leal, leader of the patriotic union, deputy chairman jose anteguera, and others.  threats continue to be made against the union and against the pcc.  all members of the pcc leadership have received death threats.  the same also applies to bernardo jaramillo, the present leader of the union, gilberto vieira, secretary general of the pcc central committee, and others.    on 27 february comrade forero (name as transliterated), pcc secretary for organizational matters, was killed.  his wife and comrades sotelo and sotomayor also died in the atrocity.  next day, we had a meeting with virgilio barco, president of colombia.  he promises to take speedy measures against the paramilitary groups.  however, only 4 days later, anteguera, the former leader of the union of communist youth, was killed at bogota airport.  senator ernesto pisano, one of the liberal party candidates for the presidency, was seriously injured at the same time.  many members of the military were present at the airport on that day, as well as the police chief of the capital, yet only one of the murderers was killed, while the rest escaped.  this is why we told president barco that we had serious doubts about the army's role in this assassination.      next year, presidential elections and elections of the legislative bodies are due to take place in colombia.  the pcc and the patriotic union want to take part in them, but we have warned the leaders of the republic that unless the \"dirty war\" is ended, we will expose the situation in colombia to the world and regard the election results as illegal.  despite everything, we consider that the patriotic union has a promising future, because its aims are supported by the colombian people.\n",

      "  a self-named ultra-right-wing commando unit, the \"gerardo barrios civic force\" (fuerza civica gerardo barrios) tonight claimed responsibility for the dynamite attack that killed salvadoran attorney general roberto garcia today.      in telephone calls to local radio stations, the commando unit stated: \"we were born through antisubversive combat; however, we are an essentially democratic force, because we have come to confront the monopolizing and totalitarian efforts of arena (nationalist republican alliance), which will be the ruling party as of 1 june.\"    the new \"death squad\" spokesman said:  \"we are confronting the worthless (vice president-elect) merino and (arena leader) d'aubuisson.  we recently gave them a dissuasive signal, and today we gave them a second one...\"    last week francisco merino's residence was the target of a bomb attack, though there were no casualties (as received).    \"we are against every act of intrigue and conspiracy within the armed forces and current acts of repression by the state security organizations, as well as all actions against democratic institutions like the christian democracy.\"    in conclusion, the communique adds a veiled threat against francisco guerrero, president of the supreme court of justice, who is charged with a \"fifth column action.\"    this is the second \"death squad\" that has made its appearance in the country in less than a week.    on 14 april, shortly after the attack on merino, the self-styled \"guardians of free enterprise\" made its appearance and harshly criticized the chiefs of the salvadoran army who \"obey pressures from abroad.\"\n",

      "  recently comrade manuel cepeda, member of the colombian communist party central committee politburo, visited czechoslovakia; we asked him for an interview.    (posledni) in the course of a few days at the beginning of march, three leading officials of the colombian communist party and the leftist coalition, the patriotic union (up), comrades forero, sotelo, and antequera, were murdered in colombia.  why?      (cepeda) in colombia the dirty war stemming from the american tactics of so-called low-intensity conflict is intensifying.  the internal political crisis is deepened by an alliance between the powerful drug smuggling clans and the military leadership which is conducting the dirty war.  in the santa fe ii document, formulating future united states policy in latin america, it is even said that unless the united states intervenes in the 1990's colombia will become another el salvador and on a much larger scale.  the so-called extermination operation, also known as the condor plan, is directed against the communist party and up, against the unions, but also against priests who preach liberation theology, and recently this has intensified.  in colombia some elements of fascism openly manifest themselves.  this is manifested in huge and unpunished massacres and in the powerlessness of president barco and his civilian ministers who are not managing to keep the military leadership in check, although the president is the supreme commander of the armed forces.    (posledni) sometimes partisans are also accused of terror.      (cepeda) that is one of the traits of american policy -- to term any kind of revolutionary struggle, of struggle for democracy, and the people's movement as terrorism.  therefore, it also labels the sandinistas in nicaragua as terrorists and the contra rebels as freedom fighters.  by this i do not want to say that the partisans do not make mistakes, we also criticize them.  for example, we condemned the destruction of oil piplines by the colombian partisan organization the national liberation army (eln). we do not agree with kidnapping civilians in exchange for ransom.  we announced that, as long as it is impossible to end the conflict, it is necessary to humanize it and to respect human lives.  these are the tactics of soldiers -- to label the partisans as terrorists and then massacre the civilian population as suspects who are collaborating with terrorism.    (posledni) partisans from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) offered the government a dialogue about a truce.  how do they want to conduct this?    (cepeda) the farc, which is the strongest element of the colombian partisan movement and a member of its coordinating committee, unilaterally adopted a cease-fire and proposed the creation of a commission for this dialogue.  in it are two former presidents, the liberal lopez michelsen and the conservative pastrana, the chairman of the association of industrialists echeverri correa, and bogota's cardinal rebollo.  the farc wants the government to disband the paramilitary groups.  the former interior minister, gaviria, said that there are 140 of them.  this means that the government knows them.  the farc is demanding the purge of people from the army command involved in the dirty war, that the defense minister be a civilian, that the state of emergency be revoked, and that the road to real democracy be opened.    (posledni) but the government has begun negotiating with partisans from m-19.    (cepeda) the el tiempo newspaper reported that the government promised them representation in parliament by their inclusion as candidates of the liberal party.  this is to involve four seats as long as m-19 lays down its arms and disbands.  the other partisans bitterly criticized this as a blow against the unity of the movement which will be abused for propaganda purposes.  at the same time, m-19 represents only 5 percent of the movement.  it is the intention of the government to divide the partisans.    (posledni) the colombian communist party congress took place in december.  how did it react to the situation?    (cepeda) the party called for peace and outlined the struggle for a pluralist government of transition towards peace and democracy.  at the end of february there was a central committee session which discussed the dirty war.  it stated that, in spite of the terror, there had not been what had happened in similar situations in other latin american countries, namely, mass emigration.  to ensure that this does not happen in the future, the central committee discussed new measures, including the transition of part of the party to the underground.  we will not all transfer, because now we must struggle for open contact with the masses, regardless of the huge risk which is linked to this.    (posledni) where is the party seeking allies?      (cepeda) comrade antequera, as deputy chairman of the up, had established a number of contacts.  however, he was murdered, and senator samper pisano, a politician from the ruling liberal party, was seriously injured during the assassination at bogota airport on 3 march.  the assassination attempt against the 32-year-old prospective politician occurred the day after he announced his candidacy for the presidency.  he announced his support for democratic coexistence, for an end to the dirty war which, as he said, is not in the interest of the colombian people.  therefore, he was not a chance victim.  it is also significant that the closed circuit television covering the airport, which is in the hands of the army, was switched off.  thus, they wanted to prevent the murderers being filmed.  one of them died, they let the other three escape.  at the same time, bogota's chief of police was at the airport along with another 10 colonels and a number of policemen and personal bodyguards.    (posledni) how did the other parties react to the assassination?    (cepeda) a joint document was signed by the colombian communist  party, the up, and the liberal party, on whose behalf the former president turbay ayala signed.  it demands that the government disband the paramilitary squads.  it shows that opinions are beginning to differ, even in the ruling liberal party.  the conservatives are also emphatically criticizing the bloodbath and the passivity of the government, pointing out that their last president, betancur, conducted a dialogue with the partisans.  this is all happening before the elections which will take place next year.    (posledni) the colombian communist party leadership met with the president after the murder of comrade forero.  what was that about?    (cepeda) in the conversation, we pointed to the fact that the defense minister, general guerrero paz, travels around colombia accompanied by the leader of the ultra-right wing, retired general landazabal reyes, who is leader of the paramilitary groups.  we asked why these two are together. the president did not answer us.  at the meeting we also said that, unless the dirty war stops, the colombian communist party for the first time in history will not take part in the elections.  we will not be able to participate, because we are all being murdered.  unless the government gives us a guarantee of security, we will not sacrifice more lives.    (posledni) thank you for the interview.\n",

      "  president-elect alfredo cristiani yesterday announced changes in the army's strategy toward urban terrorism and the farabundo marti national liberation front's (fmln) diplomatic offensive to isolate the new government abroad.    cristiani said: \"we must adjust our political-military strategy and modify laws to allow us to professionally counter the fmln's strategy.\"    during a news conference yesterday morning, the president-elect and member of the nationalist republican alliance (arena) presented the basic viewpoints of his administration, which will replace christian democrat napoleon duarte's administration on 1 june.    as the president-elect was making this statement, he learned about the assasination of attorney general roberto garcia alvarado.  (sentence as published) alvarado was killed by a bomb presumably placed by an urban guerrilla group on top of his armored vehicle as it stopped at an intersection in san miguelito neighborhood, north of the capital.    the fmln is abandoning \"guerrilla warfare tactics in rural areas and increasingly resorting to the establishment of civilian fronts in the main cities and to urban terrorism in an attempt to destabilize (the government).  at the international level, the guerrillas are trying to elicit negative reaction toward the new government to isolate us politically from the world,\" cristiani said.  vice president-elect francisco merino accompanied him.    he added: \"obviously, if warranted by the situation, we must resort to legal mechanisms.  should the situation become difficult or impossible to control, our harsher measure would be to declare a state of siege.\"    since early april, the fmln has been carrying out a strong offensive against private companies and the banking system and has stepped up sabotage actions against telephone and electricity networks.    in addition to the attack on the attorney general, there were other attacks, in which guerrilla deserter miguel castellanos and francisco pecorrini, both of whom were right-wing ideologues, were killed and carlos mendoza, chief editor of analisis magazine, was wounded.  castellanos and pecorrini were connected with that magazine.\n",

      "  official sources reported today that the salvadoran guerrilla groups have increased their sabotage against the national electrical system in the past few hours, leaving 40 percent of the national territory without electricity, while intermittent blackouts have occurred in the rest of the country.    the entire eastern zone of the country was without electricity today, according to a report from the lempa river hydroelectric executive commission (cel), which stated that on monday, farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) guerrillas blew up several structures in that region.    the report added that the sabotage occurred on the outskirts of usulutan department, where other structures were also blown up early this morning. in this capital, fmln urban commandoes blew up at least three poles supporting secondary lines, and an as yet undetermined number of poles and towers in different locations in the country's central and western region.    in the wake of the new attacks against the electrical system, on monday the cel started a turbogas plant in the eastern city of san miguel to partially solve the country's energy crisis.    meanwhile, national police director colonel carlos guzman said that the fmln will accelerate the sabotage as 1 june approaches, when the right-wing nationalist republican alliance (arena) will take power.    col guzman also announced that military intelligence has discovered \"plans to murder\" armed forces high command members and future arena administration officials.  guzman added that the plans would be carried out by fmln urban commandos.  \"the death threats do not frighten us,\" he said, without providing details on the guerrillas' plans to carry out the murders.\n",

      "  the peruvian police today arrested 10 people suspected of having detonated a car bomb some 300 meters from government house where president alan garcia and his family were sleeping.    the police reported that the powerful shock wave destroyed windows and doors in a 400-meter radius, but no injuries were reported.    the police attributed the attack to the tupac amaru revolutionary movement (mrta).  the explosion took place at 0150 (0650 gmt) on block no. 3 on ancash street, in front of the san francisco monastery and the national institute of culture.    witnesses told police that they saw three well-dressed young men adandoning the car, apparently activating the bomb by remote control some 100 meters away.  the suspects then fled in another car that was awating them.    this is the second car bomb planted by the mrta since 7 may, when the terrorist group blew up another vehicle in front of the san martin military quarters, an army administrative unit located in the lima disctrict of miraflores.    the mrta, which has detonated about 20 car bombs, began its activities in 1984.  two weeks ago, the army shot 65 mrta members in a clash in jauja, in the central mountian region.    in related developments, the departments of pasco, junin, and huanuco returned to normal today after a 72-hour \"armed strike\" called by the maoist terrorist group the shining path.  trade, mining, and banking activities in these important andean departments were completely paralyzed during the strike.    one army officer and a civilian died, 5 policemen and 2 civilizans were injured, and some $20 million was lost in property damage during the strike.    the main peruvian mines of lead, silver, zinc, gold, and copper are located in these three departments. approximately 40,000 mineworkers observed the strike out of fear of shining path retaliation.\n",

      "  concerning dr jose antonio rodriguez porth's death, the farabundo marti national liberation front general command reports the following to all salvadorans:    1. as a result of investigations we have conducted, we confirm that the fmln bears no responsibility whatsoever for the attack on dr rodriguez porth.  we delayed making this statement to make certain that there were no circumstantial or other reasons that could have involved us in the attack.    2. following rodriguez porth's death, several groups have conducted markedly vengeful actions.  colonel ochoa perez, for example, has proposed fighting fire with fire.  francisco merino has threatened opposition leaders with death.  ricardo alvarenga valdivieso has proposed repressive new laws.    we hereby warn that if reprisals are taken against the opposition movement, we will take firm and resolute action against any escalation in repression.    3. we find the false commotion among the ranks of the arena (nationalist republican alliance) party repulsive, because everyone knows of their responsibility in killings like that of monsignor romero, of the members of the fdr (revolutionary democratic front) executive committee, and so many others.  we do not believe in their alleged innocence, and do even less at a time when repressive actions are being intensified.    4. our attention has been drawn to the fact that the attack on rodriguez porth occurred within the framework of an intense struggle between the entrepreneurial sector (of arena) and d'aubuisson's supporters to gain control of the party, and within the framework of a dispute for the defense ministry.  in the latter case, rodriguez porth's actions did away with general bustillo's aspirations.  there are precedents for the line of conduct of arena factions and for these internal confrontations.  we recall the attack that roberto d'aubuisson perpetrated against former u.s. ambassador thomas pickering.  we also remember how important men close to major roberto d'aubuission participated in the kidnapping of businessmen. major d'aubuission's silence concerning the attack on rodriguez porth is noteworthy.    the fmln understands the concern of the various national sectors and the international community in the sense that arena may use this fact to justify irrational retaliatory actions.  if a situation is brought about, involving an increase in violence and expansion of the war, it will be the arena government's sole responsibility, not ours.    for this reason, we have raised with the political parties the need to create conditions for establishing a favorable climate for dialogue and a negotiated political solution.  we reiterate our total readiness to contribute toward this effort.  the fmln reasserts to all the salvadoran people that we will continue to adhere to the truth and that that we will be fully responsible for our actions at all times and under any circumstances.    (signed) fmln general command     (dated) 15 june 198, el salvador\n",

      "  the damage caused by the latest terrorist attacks against the country's oil pipeline has so far been estimated at almost 75 billion pesos. according to ecopetrol (colombian petroleum enterprise), there have been four dynamite attacks on the pipeline in the last 72 hours. because of the attacks, colombia will have to abstain from marketing crude oil abroad for 3 weeks, thus losing $150 million.  the damage caused to the covenas plant amounts to $7 million; another $7 million will have to be spent on repairs.    ecopetrol president andres restrepo londono said that the colombian people will feel the impact of these attacks.  already the royalties given to the municipalities have been suspended, and an increase in fuel prices will be necessary, according to the first special meeting of the country's petroleum enterprise authorities.    meanwhile, the army has increased its counteroffensive against eln (army of national liberation) guerrillas, which have claimed responsibility for the attacks on the oil pipeline, exerting pressure to modify the oil policy.  the latest attack on the pipeline occurred at the lisama installations, located between barrancabermeja and bucaramanga.  eln guerrillas attacked these installlations, which are responsible for producing gas and petroleum.  the guerrillas cut 80 percent of the cables attached to the motors which extract fuel.    a dynamite charge was also placed on the pipeline at km-28 in cano limon-covenas, in the area of carmen, near the tonchala river, in northern santander.  no fuel, however, was lost.  the attacks have now extended to huila department for the first time, damaging fuel installations.  here the oil spill was stopped by closing down the installations.    furthermore, nine guerrillas have been killed, eight more have been captured, and an eln training center has been dismantled.  this is the result of the army's first counterinsurgency actions against those determined to do away with the nation's resources by attacking the cano limon-covenas pipeline.  military authorities have reported that near serrania de perija, cesar department, the 2d brigade's (la popa) battalion troops clashed with eln guerrillas.  the clash resulted in the death of six guerrillas and the confiscation of a great amount of war materiel.    in addition, (words indistinct) the army dismantled an eln urban network, capturing eight of its members.  meanwhile, the 14th brigade's (luciano de luria) battalion troops killed jose antonio velasco, a farc (revolutionary armed forces of colombia) leader.  finally, 5th brigade troops are continuing their actions in the cacatumbo area, where the eln has taken refuge.  the eln, commanded by spanish priest manuel perez, has based its operations in eastern colombia.\n",

      "  guatemalan president vinicio cerezo today revealed there have been two attempts to murder him since he assumed the presidentcy on 14 january 1986.      cerezo, who avoided giving details about the two attempts, stated that \"there is specific information\" about an alleged plan to murder him.  he added, however, that no one can be arrested without evidence.    cerezo asserted that he withdrew last week to santo tomas farm, approximately 43 km south of guatemala city, to think, study guatemala's problems, and rest.      cerezo said he also retreated to his farm to give his security officials an opportunity to reschedule activities and change methods to increase their protection without affecting the population or the relationship between the president and the people.    answering questions about the summoning of four civilians who were linked with one of the plans to murder him, cerezo said they were summoned by the police to provide information about the alleged plan.    the second plan was revealed early this month by hugo arce, a columnist of the guatemalan opposition newspaper el grafico, who   the murder was going to be carried out by a libyan commando unit that had entered guatemala in december 1988 and had been trained in cuba.    cerezo said that arce must tell everything he knows, because otherwise \"he would be concealing the plan, which is a crime to do.\"    other civilians who will also be summoned by the attorney general's office are mario david garcia, nicolas buonafina, both suspected of involvement in the attempted coup of may 1988, and juan maegli.    president cerezo said he trusts his security forces and that it is very easy to display a large-scale protection system, but \"that is neither my style nor that of my assistants,\" cerezo stressed.    cerezo added that the state has security mechanisms to determine whether strange things are happening in the country but those mechanisms cannot always be used as evidence to arrest a person.    cerezo did not provide information about the first alleged plan to murder him.\n",

      "  as izvestiya has already reported, on 5 july at 1000 hours local (peru) time, a bus with soviet seamen on board was blown up by a bomb.  as a result of the explosion 20 people were injured, of whom 17 were hospitalized, 3 of them in a serious condition.    our mexico city correspondent a. cherepanov called embassy and ministry of the fishing industry representatives in lima.  here are the additional details he managed to obtain.  on the morning of 5 july a group of 52 people in two buses visited the \"albatros\" store, as is the custom among off-duty crews from soviet fishing vessels working in peruvian coastal waters.  the explosion occurred on one of the buses as it was about to leave.    fortunately, the bomb was homemade and not that powerful.  and it had obviously been hastily planted (according to witnesses, four suspicious characters had been hanging around the bus).  the passengers were injured mainly by pieces of broken glass.    the police and emergency services were on the scene immediately.  nearly all the casualties were immediately hospitalized.  it is true that at first there was a mixup in the hospital over russian names -- it took the doctors a while to work out which photograph belonged to whom.  representatives of the soviet embassy and consulate came to their aid.  on the same day skilled operations were carried out on all those who required them.  the izvestiya correspondent was officially informed that the seriously injured soviet seamen were out of danger.  their families had been informed.    the peruvian press believes that the terrorist act carried out against soviet citizens was the work of the maoist-inclined leftist armed grouping \"sendero luminoso.\"  but there is another version:  it might have been carried out by ultrarightists opposing the fishing agreements signed between peru and the ussr.\n",

      "  television station and at least one radio station, spokesmen of television channel 7 -- which was the television station affected by the blast -- told dpa.         according to initial reports, the bomb was set off on alux mountain, approximately 20 km west of the guatemalan capital.  most radio and television stations have transmission towers on that mountain because it towers over a vast area of guatemala.    it has been learned that a man, who is believed to have been the watchman at channel 7's tower, was killed by the bomb.  the spokesmen (for channel 7) said that rescue units sent to the site have yet to return to the capital.    the explosion was felt in several nearby communities and in a sector of guatemala city.  channel 7 suddenly went off the air just as guatemalan president vinicio cerezo arevalo was about to deliver a speech. nevertheless, the speech was broadcast by the other four television channels that operate in guatemala.      this terrorist action comes in the wake of a series of incidents that have occurred in the past few days as a result of strikes by teachers, post office workers, finance ministry employees, and other sectors demanding wage increases.    a bomb was found before it exploded in a bank in the afternoon of 19 july, and several anonymous callers warned about other terrorist bombs last night; however, these turned out to be false alarms.\n",

      "  with simultaneous bomb explosions in the honduran capital and la ceiba port, located approximately 355 km from tegucigalpa on the atlantic coast, a new guerrilla group calling itself the \"9 may\" people's liberation forces, fpl, announced its emergence as one of the armed organizations struggling for power.    three bombs went off simultaneously in tegucigalpa, one at the central park, another at the state-run university of honduras, and another at a training school for teachers.  at the same time, a bomb exploded at a university branch in la ceiba.      all the blasts occurred at 1130 (local time).  only one person who happened to be passing by the central park in tegucigalpa at the time of the explosion was wounded as a result of the blasts.  a communique issued by the new group points out that \"one does not weep for martyrs, but avenges them\" and adds that \"traitor indians come before the invading gringos.\"    the proclamation criticizes the murder of popular leaders that took place in the country in early july and denounces other leftist labor and guerrilla organizations.    the armed forces, through its commander, general humberto regalado hernandez, responded immediately by stating that \"the only real communists left in the world are hondurans, because they are changing in other countries\" and are no longer exploding bombs.      the military leader asked people to attach no significance to the incident and said that should the wave of political violence continue, leftist groups would have to be called to a dialogue to avoid other similar actions.    the \"9 may\" fpl proclamation was issued in the northern city of san pedro sula, 255 km from tegucigalpa.\n",

      "  the salvadoran army is on a state of alert and has increased its surveillance in san salvador to counter a new guerrilla offensive, which has caused at least 48 military casualties over the past 24 hours in several actions throughout the country.    treasury police director colonel heriberto hernandez reported that the state of alert is designed to prevent sabotage and the delivery of weapons for the guerrillas.  it includes an increase in land and air patrols and searches of buses and private vehicles.    the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) offensive has been launched to protest the government's latest economic measures, including the deregulation of staple prices, the privatization of coffee exports and banking activities, and an increase in bus fares and electricity bills.    col hernandez said: \"the government wants what is best for the people, so land transportation users will logically be affected by the increase, but businessmen are also trying to solve their problems.\"    a clandestine rebel station asserted that the attacks were carried out in morazan, usulutan, metapan, san miguel, cabanas, san vicente, la paz, san salvador, and the conflict-ridden chalatenango department.    the armed forces claimed they had no information on the number of casualties or the clashes announced by the fmln and asserted that, contrary to the fmln report, three guerrilla fighters had died and five had been killed in various clashes that occurred in northern and eastern towns, and in the salvadoran capital.      nevertheless, the army recognized that two soldiers and two civilians had died, and four were wounded in attacks on army positions and in ambushes against army and government vehicles.      the rebels also increased their sabotage activities against the electrical power system and blew up a still undetermined number of structures and telephone exchange boxes in san salvador. they also announced that they have placed explosive devices on some of the country's main highways.\n",

      "  ramon custodio lopez, president of the human rights defense committee (codeh) has predicted that the tela summit will be chaotic because, in his opinion, the honduran and salvadoran governments will interfere.  the codeh president also revealed that the battalion 3-16's new name is the counterinsurgency battalion and its commander is colonel alberto andino benitez.  custodio said this during the news conference he held 2 august.    (begin recording) (custodio) we have called this news conference because we want to warn the people, the foreign journalists who are here, and the other central american presidents about the atmosphere of insecurity which afflicts the honduran people.    first of all, we will mention the assassinations which occurred in july at san pedro sula: eduardo herrera, salomon vallecillo, and dr ramon roberto garay.  we believe that the assassinations were perpetrated by professionals so we would like a judge to call the new commander of battalion 3-16 -- now called counterinsurgency battalion -- colonel alberto andino benitez to testify.  there are reports that a member of the 3-16th battalion contacted salomon vallecillo prior to his death.    likewise, i want to mention how the citizenry is exposed to police brutality.  there is the case of justo pastor escobar silva, who was assassinated by a fusep (public security forces) agent who is now serving a prison sentence.    furthermore, people feel insecure in the country, and i will mention a case which occurred 3 weeks ago.  dr marco antonio bogran was taken with all his household employees to the dni (department of national investigation) and held from 0800 to 1500.  he was not allowed to call his lawyer or his relatives, and he was held in isolation.  he was naturally afraid the worst would happen.  no one explained anything until the end.  he was told that someone had reportedly made a subversive phone call from his house.  this means that his telephone is being illegally tapped because no one here has the right to control anyone's calls. the military men in charge of hondutel (honduran telecommunications enterprise) illegally abuse their power when they hear and control telephone calls because this should be handled by the civilian authorities.  (passage omitted) (end recording)    colonel manuel enrique suarez benavides, chief of the armed forces public relations office, has reacted to custodio lopez' statement.    (begin recording) (col suarez) i have heard part of ramon custodio's news conference on codeh foreign policy, and we observed his animosity toward the contras and his affection for the farabundo marti national liberation front in el salvador.  we thought he only handled human rights but we see he also delves in foreign policy. however, this is not the main issue.    i want to refer to the fact that years ago we publicly proved that battalion 3-16, which he mentioned so many times, had been dismantled so the unit no longer exists.  nevertheless, he seems to have forgotten this, or he may be intentionally forgetting this.  the unit disappeared but the counterintelligence battalion he mentions does exist and its commander, which he mentions, is a member of the armed forces.  in other words, he has absolutely nothing to do with the activities that battalion 3-16 reportedly carried out.  if custodio wants it, we can send him a copy of the agreements to dismantle battalion 3-16 and to appoint the current commander of the counterintelligence battalion, which has existed for many years.  that is all.  i wanted to clarify this and i hope dr custodio is more objective in his statements.  i sometimes believe that the problem of being on one side (words indistinct) the mind.    (reporter) colonel, when will the armed forces be able to give the honduran people exact information on the latest people who have been reported missing in our country?    (col suarez) excuse me, i can hardly hear you.    (reporter) i asked: when can the honduran people have exact information on the people who have been reported missing in the country?    (col suarez) look, we believe that we will shortly, and i am talking about a short time, have enough information for the honduran people on the persons you have mentioned because the investigations continue.  the police arrest people based on the suspicion or hard, rational evidence that they are involved in criminal actions.  i believe you will soon have enough information on the persons who have been arrested by the police.

      "  after the assassination of liberal leader luis carlos galan, the 4,015 judges of the country decided to lift the strike they had called on 17 august, following the assassination of a magistrate, and withdrew their resignations.    it is not the moment to go on strike or to resign, jose gabriel salom, president of the supreme tribunal of bogota, stated.  he and 47 colleagues had presented their resignation last friday to protest the assassination of magistrate carlos valencia garcia, presumably by paid assassins of drug traffickers.  valencia garcia had rejected the appeals to exonerate pablo escobar gaviria and gonzalo rodriguez gacha, kingpins of the cocaine trafficking group of the medellin cartel, from the charge that they had masterminded the assassination of journalist guillermo cano, director of the newspaper el espectador, and jaime pardo leal, president of the opposition party patriotic union.    antonio suarez, president of the judicial branch public employees association, announced that the strike has been called off and that nine judges are investigating the assassination of senator galan.      the judicial branch will resume activities on tuesday.  the strike of the judges, compounded by the resignation of some of them, interrupted the consideration of three cases.  the strike was also called to force the government of president virgilio barco to adopt measures to protect the magistrates whose lives have been threatened by organized crime.    among the emergency measures adopted by the government are some that will contribute to helping the judicial branch to confront the threat posed by the death squads of drug traffickers.\n",

      "  last minute report: in confusing events, police lieutenant alfredo correa and one private were killed in valle department.  no further information on this incident has been made available, other than that authorities are investigating the event.    it has also been reported that 10th army brigade members found and confiscated 2 metric tons of high-grade cocaine at la moneda farm in lechi, caucasia, at the border between antioquia and cordoba departments.  the drug was found in sealed waterproof packages in underground tunnels. this makes authorities believe the drug was ready to be air dropped over the sea to be picked up by drug traffickers. in addition, a large number of arms, a sizable amount of ammunition, as well as automobiles and radio sets were confiscated.  the drug was set on fire in the presence of judges and military authorities.  a clandestine landing strip was also destroyed.    arson seems to be the new criminal style used in antioquia.  in less than 24 hours, four farms have been set on fire.  three of these farms, located near medellin, are owned by political and industrial leaders edgar gutierrez castro, ignacio velez escobar, and augusto lopez.  the most recent of these incidents occurred at the llano grande country club early this morning. several armed men showed up at the site and set the club on fire after threatening and beating up the watchmen.  the amount of the losses has not yet been determined.  the manager did not allow reporters into the place.  it was reported, however, that the attackers identified themselves as extraditables who said the action was being taken in reprisal for the government actions against them.  the armed men left the place shouting that their reaction has just begun and that their struggle will continue. further damage to the club and the loss of human life were prevented by workers who reacted promptly.    the colombian government has taken measures to counteract these actions. the army this afternoon will receive the initial u.s.  tactical support as part of the new antiterrorist offensive, government sources have reported. u.s. military cargo planes will fly to colombia armed twin-turbine bell-212 helicopters.  in addition, the pentagon will ship radio communications equipment.  the helicopters will be flown by colombian military crews, u.s. state department sources said in washington.  for the time being, both george bush's administration and virgilio barco's government are not considering the presence of u.s. military men in colombia.      over the past 72 hours, the army raided five farms, one home, and a bar-restaurant owned by gonzalo rodriguez gacha, camilo zapata, and pablo escobar gaviria.  the raids were conducted by 13th brigade troops in chia, pacho, and bogota.  this farm, known as el castillo de marroquin, owned by zapata and estimated to be worth more than 100 billion pesos, was raided on wednesday afternoon.  according to the army, this veritable fortress, located on the el comun bridge, was managed by retired police major alvaro tovar tovar.  luxurious cars, a gold-ornamented chapel, a swimming pool fitted with a heating system, 15 stables with fine horses, a tennis court, and the impressive castle all make up a farm worth millions.  extensive gardens, long trails, and an attractive lake complement the wonderful natural landscape of the real estate right by the bogota northern freeway.  there are exotic adornments on the walls.  for instance, there is a botero painting worth 4 million pesos.  in one room, there were many electric appliances and a full radio communications set.  the exorbitant wealth is indicated by even a witchcraft room.

      "  1. on sunday 20 august, eight fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) disabled war comrades occupied the (san salvador metropolitan) cathedral, where they remain still to protest the violations by the arena (nationalist republican alliance) government of international law as well as non-compliance to the commitments made when the release and exchange of colonel (omar napoleon) avalos was negotiated in panama (in 1987).    2.  the fmln general command greets the disabled comrades and congratulates them on demanding that they be allowed to leave the country and obtain adequate medical attention.  the fmln general command also calls on the salvadoran people and the international community to offer solidarity and support for the just demands of the war disabled.  we recognize and encourage the humanitarian assistance that msgr arturo rivera y damas is giving in finding a just solution to this problem despite the government hindering his work as a mediator in solving the conflict.    3.  on several occasions, the armed forces has assaulted fmln hospitals, captured, tortured, and murdered medical staff and patients.  also, they have captured, tortured, and murdered disabled persons in various circumstances.  this behavior is in sharp contrast with the fmln's strict respect for the hospitals, medical staff, as well as the armed forces' disabled and wounded personnel, although they are vulnerable targets of our actions.  the fmln general command reiterates this policy of principles and demands the same behavior from the armed forces.    4.  following the occupation of the cathedral by the disabled, (president alfredo) cristiani is trying to make the case an object of negotiation, demanding certain actions of the fmln.  this attitude by the arena government might make the problem more complex and make us revert to circumstances we had already surpassed.  the departure from the country of the disabled is a right that the government should respect, and this cannot be considered an issue that can be used for negotiations or blackmail.    we are sure that this just demand which has led the disabled comrades to stay at the cathedral until they and their comrades can leave the country will be supported by all of our people, while international solidarity will leave it clearly established that cristiani, arena, and the armed forces are acting in an unjust and incorrect manner.

      "  in view of the recent incidents at tobalaba airport, the communist party of chile (pcch) has issued the following communique:    the dictatorship intends to use still unclear incidents that took place a few days ago at tobalaba airport to create a climate of provocation and alarm with the purpose of disrupting the development of the political process that should lead to a democratic victory on 14 december.    pinochet's open intervention in the development of the electoral process remained clear in his 23 august speech and was recently denounced by opposition leader patricio aylwin and by all opposition political forces.    the declaration issued by the national intelligence center, cni -- an organization that for many years has shamefully violated the most basic rights of the chilean people by using the most cruel and inhuman forms of terror and violence against chilean democrats and whose dissolution has been proposed even by the government's candidate hernan buchi -- intends to misguide the people by once again trying to implicate the pcch in an incident in which it had no participation whatsoever.    the cni declaration, expressly ordered by authorities of the regime, goes to the extreme of infamously manipulating family ties to attack our general secretary, comrade volodia teitelboim.    the regime seeks to create a climate of terror and intimidation in order to impose the antidemocratic demands recently made by pinochet.    to this end, and as pinochet himself has stated, the regime is willing even to resort to force once again.  part of this plan is the murder of luis vargas, who was arrested and tortured by the cni and later thrown out of a fifth- floor window of the military court building after being falsely charged with having an arsenal in his home; the scandalous court decision that leaves unpunished those responsible for the inhuman death of rodrigo rojas denegri and the serious injury of carmen gloria quintana; the shameful supreme court decision clearing those responsible for the horrible crimes against 10 chileans in late 1976; the regime's intention to impose a new amnesty law to leave thousands of cases of violation of human rights in the past 16 years unpunished; the arrest and incommunicado detention of 13 people, among them a pregnant woman allegedly involved in the incidents at the tobalaba airport and for whose physical and psychological integrity we fear.    this is the consequence of pinochet, the cni, and the circles close to the dictatorship's despair in view of the progress made by the democratic struggle and the growing unity of all oposition forces around a single presidential candidate and a common platform designed to democratize the country.    as always when it feels threatened, the dictatorship has decided to divide and confuse the opposition forces.    we appeal to all democrats to come together even more firmly so the level of unity achieved by the opposition sector will not allow such maneuvers to jeopardize the resolute progress toward the much desired democracy and freedom for our people.    we also urge that this provocation be denounced by doubling efforts to overwhelmingly defeat the dictatorship on 14 december, thus taking a decisive step in the struggle to definitively oust this regime of hatred, death, and pain.    signed: americo zorrilla, jaime insunza, and carlos molinas for the communist party of chile.\n",

      "  seven powerful bombs were set off in bogota and medellin early this morning in what seems to be the continuation of the \"war\" declared by the drug traffickers in reprisal for the major blows they have been dealt by the authorities in various areas of colombia.      according to the initial police reports, six bombs exploded in medellin, the country's second-largest city, where the response from the drug dealers has been more strongly felt in recent days.    the bombs were placed in liquor stores where, according to official estimates, the damage is extensive.    medellin was the first city hit by the drug cartel's \"counterattack\" after the so-called \"extraditables\" issued a communique in which they vowed to wage a \"war\" on the government, judges, businessmen, and journalists nationwide.  the extraditables are drug traffickers sought by u.s. courts.    on sunday, nine bombs exploded and completely destroyed several state-owned banks.    meanwhile, another bomb exploded in bogota in front of a travel agency, but the extent of the damage has yet to be reported.    the intense offensive by president virgilio barco's administration began 2 weeks ago in the wake of a number of criminal attacks that claimed the lives of presidential hopeful luis carlos galan, a high-ranking police officer, and a judge.    the police reported today that for the first time, combined army and police forces raided several properties owned by hernando suarez burgos, (words indistinct) the ruling liberal party, in southwestern narino department.    units of the elite forces, the main ones involved in the operations, also raided the private residence of businessman edgardo barros, president of the sporting soccer club of cali.    police spokesmen also reported today that more than 7,000 people who had been arrested since the beginning of the offensive were released when it was fully proven they had no links with the drug mafias.    meanwhile, approximately 4,000 people remain in custody awaiting judicial rulings.\n",

      "  the colombian defense ministry in bogota confirmed today that at least three-fourths of the 10,797 people arrested after senator luis carlos galan's murder on 18 august have been released.    the releases took place as the preventive arrest deadlines established in the state of siege decrees issued on 25 august by president virgilio barco's liberal government began to expire.    colonel eduardo arevalo, press director for the defense ministry, told afp that the authorities could only detain suspects for 7 working days.    it is quite different when arrests are made on specific drug trafficking charges, he explained.    \"there are no exact figures regarding the persons released, but i can assure you that at least three-fourths of the detainees are involved,\" col arevalo said.    that proportion of the almost 10,797 detentions made during the operations carried out throughout the country against common criminals and presumed accomplices of the drug trafficking mafias, leads to the assumption that approximately 3,500 people remain in custody at the jails, police inspection offices, and other branches.    the legal situation of these individuals will be established as their terms expire in accordance with the law, arevalo said.    arevalo explained to afp that there have been a few difficulties regarding those who have been detained and arrested, adding that the difficulties stem from the work stoppage in the judicial branch in protest over the assassination of justice carlos valencia in bogota.      he said that among the detainees are three individuals who could be extradited to the united states.    one of the extraditables is eduardo martinez romero, captured while he was vacationing on his farm in tolu, a village in the northwestern province of sucre on the caribbean coast, approximately 750 km from bogota, and his transfer to the united states could come at any moment.    the procedures for martinez romero's extradition were carried out uneventfully after the u.s. embassy made the request.  however, it has been reported that his extradition may be postponed for a few days because the supreme court suspended the deadlines for the election of justices at 27 higher courts.    the supreme court's constitutional chamber and the attorney general have 10 working days to state their positions regarding the legality of the executive decrees, without which the government would have to abstain from authorizing future extraditions.    \"we must not act hastily because we do not want to make errors.  some of the extraditables may be innocent,\" communications minister carlos lemus told afp.\n",

      "  a new terrorist action shook medellin in northwestern colombia this evening when two men riding on a motorcycle threw an explosive device at a police post located in the exclusive suburb of el poblado.  miraculously, the three policemen and two civilians who were inside escaped injury.    the post, known as an immediate attention center (cai), which plays the role of a police control post, was destroyed by the explosion of the device.    three policemen and two civilians were inside the post, which was not fully operational because it had not been completely built, but managed to escape.    one of the policemen told afp that they saw two men on a motorcycle swiftly passing by the cai and then throwing a red plastic bag.    the three policemen and the two civilians managed to run a few meters down the street before the device exploded.    although the device's power has yet to be established by experts, the detonation was strong enough to destroy the structure, measuring approximately 11 square meters.    precisely 1 month ago the same cai had been destroyed when its walls were being constructed.    a woman who passed through the area at the time of the attack was not injured either, even though her vehicle sustained considerable damage, particularly the windows, which were destroyed.    the new terrorist action occurred 12 hours after a man was involved in a spectacular shoot-out at the jose maria cordoba airport in medellin, where the gunman and a young man died and 10 persons were wounded, including three policemen.    the cai's destruction occurred 4 hours after the beginning of the curfew, imposed by mayor juan gomez martinez 6 days ago in an attempt to curtail the terrorist actions which have shaken the city, birthplace of the medellin drug cartel.\n",

      "  a radio station newsman has reported that an alleged spokesman for \"the extraditables,\" a group that claims to be linked to the medellin cartel, has claimed responsibility for the burning of a restaurant today and a 5 september sharpshooter attack at the local airport.    a newsman from radio caracol of medellin reported receiving a telephone call from a member of the extraditables claiming responsibility for the burning of a countryside restraurant. the caller justified this action by saying that the restarants' owners paid homage to a military leader.    medellin, which is the drug traffickers' trading headquarters in colombia, was hit by a wave of threats that turned out to be nothing but false alarms that nevertheless prompted the police to constantly patrol the city and evacuate shopping centers in search of nonexistent bombs.    workers said that the restaurant, whose owner was a follower of recently assassinated presidential candidate luis carlos galan, was torched by rifle-toting youths.    they locked four workers in an office until the fire started.  the restaurant suffered 20 million pesos ($50,000) in loses.    he also said that the extraditables are responsible for an attack on 5 september in which a man dressed in combat gear fired an automatic rifle at industrialists and businessmen at the medellin airport.    the sharpshooter, who was shot by policemen, managed to kill 1 person and wound 12 others.  the anonymous caller gave no explanation for the attack, a caracol newsman told reuter.    two weeks ago the extraditables declared \"total war\" against the government of president virgilio barco after he launched a campaign to repress the drug barons in which 11,000 individuals were arrested and millions of dollars in property owned by drug traffickers were confiscated.\n",

      "  the police reported today that u.s. journalist bernardette pardo, who was sent to colombia by the spanish-speaking univision television network to cover the colombian government's \"war\" against drug traffickers, was injured last night during an attack in medelliln.    it was learned that pardo was in a restaurant in medellin accompanied by cameraman carlos corrales and colombian movie actor jorge saenz when a medium-intensity bomb exploded in the establishment.    pardo, of cuban origin, suffered fractures in her clavicle and right shoulder blade and wounds in her neck.  she is currently at a hospital in medellin.  corrales was injured by splinters in various parts of his body.    the police reported that the attack was apparently carried out by a couple that was sitting at a table close to the journalists. according to reports, a woman went to the restroom, then left in a hurry followed by the man, who was accompanying her, shortly before the explosion.    on the night of 3 september unidentified individuals placed two bombs in a parking lot and garden of a medellin hotel where several foreign journalists were staying.  the journalists arrived in colombia a few days ago to cover the intensification of the government's struggle against narcotics-trafficking organizations.    although no one was injured in that incident, it was clear that the medellin cartel, the largest drug-trafficking ring in the world, had declared an all-out \"war\" against foreign journalists who remain colombia.    likewise, colombian journalists were threatened a few days after the government's offensive began, in reprisal for the hard blows dealt to the drug cartel, in the past 3 weeks.    in a statement for a french newspaper, pablo escobar gaviria, the medellin cartel's main \"capo\" said that journalists and judges \"will pay the consequences\" of the government's struggle, which has resulted in hundreds of drug traffickers arrested and numerous properties owned by drug traffickers confiscated.    the attack against the univision journalists occurred simultaneously with an announcement by the police in antioquia department -- the capital of which is medellin -- of the arrest of four drug traffickers whose extradition may have been requested by the united states.    the names of the drug traffickers were not disclosed to the press. however, it was learned that their arrest took place during intensive operations which took place in this city during the past few hours as a result of which 21 mercenaries of the medellin cartel have fallen.    members of the same narcotics-trafficking organization detonated two bombs in financial institutions and set a restaurant on fire in medellin, police spokesmen reported.\n",

      "  last night a bomb destroyed a branch of the state-owned central mortgage bank in this city. meanwhile, another explosive device thrown at the state-owned agrarian fund, near itagui municipality, failed to go off.    the police reported that the first terrorist action nearly destroyed the credit institution located in guayabal, on the outskirts of medellin in northwestern colombia.    the explosion, which caused no casualties, occured at 0130 gmt on 7 september.    meanwhile, a device made up of 10 kg of dynamite, which was thrown from a motorcycle at a branch of the agrarian fund, failed to explode because its detonation mechanism malfunctioned.    the failed action took place in nearby itagui municipality, which has been enforcing a curfew for the past 8 days along with medellin in an attempt to control the deteriorated public order situation.    beginning tonight, the police and army will redouble security measures in these two cities, because terrorist attacks, which have been attributed to drug traffickers who are waging a war against colombian authorities, over the past week have always taken place late in the evening.\n",

      "  colombian defense ministry spokesmen reported today that army troops dealt a harsh blow to the medellin drug cartel over the past few hours.  the army troops seized five farms owned by gonzalo rodriguez gacha, the second most important medellin drug cartel chief.    according to official reports, the troops arrived at a rural area in central boyaca port municipality and raided five farms which, according to preliminary evidence, were used by the mafia to train rightist paramilitary groups.    according to secret police investigations, the paramilitary squads were formed by the medellin cartel to protect its interests.  the members of those squads were trained by israeli mercenaries headed by former lt col jair klein.    it was reported that since the beginning of the colombian offensive against the narco-criminal groups 3 weeks ago, joint army and police troops have seized 15 farms and several urban houses owned by gonzalez gacha.    freddy rodriguez celades, 17, son of rodriguez gacha, is still under arrest, after having been captured by the authorities along with other drug traffickers during an operation against one of the farms owned by the mafia leader.    meanwhile, it was learned today that fernando galeano berrio, suspected to be rodriguez gacha's finance chief, who was arrested a few days ago, was released by a criminal judge.    galeano berrio left his cell on thursday, 7 september, although he is one of the drug traffickers whose extradition has been requested by the united states and despite being charged with the murder of several leftist political leaders.    according to investigations, galeano was in charge of handling rodriguez gacha's finances.  thus, the possibility that galeano worked closely with eduardo martinez romero, medellin drug cartel finance chief, is not ruled out.  martinez romero was extradited to the united states on wednesday, 6 september.    reports published by the bogota morning newspaper el tiempo indicate that the authorities have confiscated 50 vehicles owned by drug baron rodriguez gacha.    according to the documents found at the medellin cartel accounting office, which operated in the middle of downtown bogota, rodriguez gacha could own approximately 400 vehicles, many of them armored vehicles or vehicles with powerful radio communications equipment.    similarly, the army seized a farm owned by pablo escobar gaviria in boyaca port municipality.  escobar is considered the world's biggest drug trafficker.    military spokesmen said that one of the many mafia schools for gunmen operated at that farm.  those gunmen are responsible for the massacres of peasants who worked in the northwestern banana region of uraba.    the operations against escobar gaviria continued yesterday when the group of mercenaries who served as escorts for escobar gaviria's  wife, maria victoria henao, was broken up.    according to reports, close aids of the capo were members of a criminal group called \"love for medellin.\"  this group is responsible for the murders of several prostitutes, homosexuals, and beggars.    it was also known that the members of the aforementioned group placed a car bomb across from the medellin telephone company, injuring five pedestrians and causing millions of pesos in property damage.    the dynamite attacks, which have become the mafia response to the government's heavy offensive, continued today when an explosive device went off at a private factory located in northwestern itagui municipality.\n",

      "  unidentified individuals today broke into a farm owned by carlos ossa, manager of the colombian institute of agrarian reform (incora), killed a watchman, and set fire to the farm.  authorities view this action as a continuation of terrorism by the drug traffickers in the country.    the incident occurred in sevilla municipality (370 km from bogota), where approximately five individuals shot to death a watchman who tried to prevent them from entering the farm.    after the 18 august assassination of senator and presidential candidate luis carlos galan, the colombian government ordered a relentless offensive against the drug mafias, which have reacted by carrying out bomb attacks and threating to kill officials, judges, businessmen, and journalists.    as incora manager, ossa has launched an intense campaign to confiscate land owned by the drug traffickers and distribute it to peasants as part of the agrarian reform being carried out by the administration of president virgilio barco.    \"we are not ruling out that the criminals are taking reprisals against ossa and all the officials who reject the activities by those criminals,\" a police spokesman told dpa.    in another action attributed to the mafias, several men last night wounded a watchman at an apartment building where maria victoria galan, the sister of galan, lives.  according to the official report, they were planning to attack her.    the resolute action of watchman javier velasco prevented the gunmen, who were riding motorcycles, from entering mrs galan's apartment.    meanwhile, members of the army, police, and security forces continued to patrol the colombian cities to prevent terrorist actions by the drug traffickers who have threatened to kill 10 colombian judges for every mafia chief who is extradited.    the colombian government last night authorized the extradition of elena beatriz zuniga rodriguez, accused by the u.s. authorities of smuggling cocaine.  this brings to two the number of colombians whose extradition is authorized in less than a week.  eduardo martinez romero, suspected \"finance chief\" of the medellin cartel, was sent to the united states on wednesday.    the bombings have mainly affected bogota and medellin, where authorities have implemented unprecedented security measures to prevent terrorist actions.    a police spokesman said that security has been reinforced in terminals, government buildings, media offices, and aqueducts of the main cities because of constant threats that the mafias will blow up those locations.    many residents of bogota have been commenting on rumors that the drug traffickers plan to place toxic substances in the aqueduct of this city of 6 million people.  the rumor has neither been denied nor confirmed by authorities.\n",

      "  pablo pelaez gonzales, 45, a former mayor of medellin, was murdered today by gunmen who fired seven shots at him, said medical sources at general hospital, where the victim was taken after the attack.    pelaez gonzalez was intercepted by several unidentified individuals while enroute to his office from his home in the el poblado neighborhood in southern medellin, colombia's second largest city, where a curfew has been in effect since 30 august.    the attack took place at approximately 0845 (1345 gmt) when, according to witnesses, at least three unidentified individuals fired from various angles at pelaez' vehicle.    the driver of the vehicle, whom authorities have not yet identified, was also killed in the attack.    pelaez gonzalez had presided over a \"session for peace\" on 18 august in medellin, which is considered one of the most violent cities in the world.    on that very day, colonel waldemar franklin quintero of the police force in antioquia department, whose capital is medellin, was murdered.    pelaez gonzalez was mayor of medellin between 3 may 1984 and the end of 1985, and was currently the president of the \"tin plate and laminating company\" (holasa).    the authorities have attributed the murder to the drug mafias, who on 24 august announced a counteroffensive to the government measures, which are a declaration of \"total war\" against drug trafficking.    on 24 august, after a number of attacks, the \"extraditables,\" the armed branch of the \"medellin cartel,\" who, with the cali cartel are considered the world's leading cocaine producers and distributors, said that they would respond to the war with attacks on \"politicians, judges, justices, union and company presidents, journalists, and the oligarchy.\"    medellin, 200 km to the northwest of bogota, has been beset by a wave of violence unleashed by the drug cartels, which over the past 3 weeks have carried out over 30 bomb attacks that have left many people injured and caused considerable damage.\n",

      "  the human rights commission of guatemala (cdh) charged here today the \"shared responsibility\" of president vinicio cerezo and the secret service of the army (g-2) in the death of four university students, whose brutally mutilated bodies were found on 10 september in a guatemala city suburb.    the finding comes in the middle of a wave of kidnappings, killings, and dynamite attacks which were unleashed starting in mid-july and which has shocked the guatemalans.  the whereabouts of seven other students, kidnapped by alleged death squads, remain unknown.  these squads have been on the rampage since 23 august.    in a communique to various political, trade union, and human rights organizations, the chdg branch in san jose requested \"urgently\" the sending of messages to the guatemalan embassies, government, and army condemning the \"impunity\" of the death squads.    two of the murdered victims -- silvia azurdia and her husband victor hugo rodriguez -- were abducted by eight men in civilian clothes before witnesses who even provided the authorities with the license plate numbers of the two vehicles used by the kidnappers.    the cdhg expressed \"deep concern over these events which reflect a total lack of political willingness\" on the part of the government to end repression against the people.    according to humanitarian organizations, guatemala holds a record in the hemisphere, 40,000 missing persons in the last 20 years.    on 11 september, it was officially reported that the mutilated and bullet-riddled bodies of three more unidentified guatemalans were found.    one of the university students killed last weekend was carlos humberto cabrera, who had returned to guatemala after several years of exile to take advantage of the guarantees announced by the christian democratic government to repatriate home any guatemalan who wished to come, the local press reported today.    on the other hand, humberto chuta, a brother of one of the victims, stated that \"it seems that we are going to live all our lives as if we were dogs.\"  he requested cerezo \"do whatever is necessary to investigate the situation, if he is not responsible for what happened.\"\n",

      "  in a first ruling, criminal judge 62 of rionegro municipality, northwestern antioquia department, has acquitted drug traffickers pablo escobar gaviria and gonzalo rodriguez gacha of charges of masterminding the murder of attorney general carlos mauro hoyos and the kidnapping of bogota city mayor andres pastrana.    the ruling was issued on the night of 25 september and revealed on 26 september.    hoyos was kidnapped on 25 january 1988 and was found dead 8 hours later near the medellin airport.  pastrana was kidnapped on 22 january 1988 but was rescued by the army 3 days later.    the \"extraditables\" claimed credit at the time for these two actions.    in his first ruling, judge francisco cardenas said \"there is not sufficient grounds or evidence\" for linking escobar gaviria and rodriguez gacha, the main chieftains of the medellin drug cartel, to the crimes.  the extradition of the drugpins has been requested by the u.s. government.    the prosecutor in the case has appealed judge cardenas' ruling before the superior tribunal of medellin, which will soon issue a pronouncement on the validity of the court ruling.\n",

      "  guatemalan security forces today declared a \"general alert\" after a radio station in the capital received a phone call in which an unidentified person threatened a generalized attack on radio stations throughout the country.    odilio deleon, 42, an announcer for radio cultural, told the police that he received a phone call yesterday in which an attack on radio stations was threatened.  no reason for the threat was given.    police sources said that in view of this report, security forces were alerted and investigations begun to identify those responsible for this plan.    over 20 months ago, the operator of a tranmission tower for channel 7 television was killed by a high-powered bomb detonated by unidentified persons.    the home of rolando archila, director general of guatemala's emisoras unidas, the radio station with the largest audience in the country, was damaged in a terrorist attack.    the christian democratic government attributed these actions to \"extreme rightist\" groups seeking to \"destabilize the democratic process initiated in january, 1986,\" after 2 decades of military regimes.    so far, it is not known if the threat to the radio stations was made by those groups, or if it came from the extreme left (the guerrillas).\n",

      "  ayacucho military sources today reported that 35 people died in attacks by about 150 shining path members against 4 towns on the border of ayacucho and huancavelica departments.    the attacks took place at dawn on 4 october in the towns of santo tomas de pata, pulluhuaman, anta, and rosaspata.  there were 26 peasants killed, and 9 rebels died at the hands of members of the civilian militia, who resisted the attacks despite their primitive weapons.    the zone where the terrorist attacks took place -- and in which 15 peasants were also seriously wounded -- is located 60 km northwest of this city.  the other towns that suffered attacks are located in santo tomas de pata district, huancavelica department, and in san pedro de cachi district, ayacucho department.    the military sources reported that in anta and pulluhuaman the terrorists set two schools and several houses on fire, killed cattle and domestic animals, and seized large amounts of basic goods.    they added that the injured were brought to this andean city, 575 km southeast of lima and huanta.    the 4 october attacks on these towns were followed today by a series of eight bomb attacks.  these attacks were carried out in several parts of the city, and one of them was against the national police headquarters, which is located at 300 meters from the main square.    there were gunshots and explosions at the police headquarters, but no victims were reported.    bomb attacks were also carried out against the state energy company, located in downtown ayacucho, causing blackouts in several areas.  explosions were heard in the carmen alto, san juan bautista, magdalena, capillapata, and conchopata neighborhoods and at the san cristobal de huamanga university.    these attacks launched by the shining path in ayacucho over the past 24 hours are part of the escalating violence that has affected several parts of the country only 5 days before the start of two presidential \"summits\" that will be held in ica department, located in the southern region of peru.    the presidents of bolivia, colombia, and peru are scheduled to meet to discuss the drug trafficking issue on 10 october in paracas.  the \"group of eight\" summit, (comprising argentina, brazil, colombia, mexico, peru, uruguay, and venezuela), is scheduled to be held 11-12 october in ica, the capital of the department.\n",

      "  four men, who had 250 kg of dynamite with them, were arrested today by the bogota police who said they had dismantled a band of individuals who were sowing terror in this city.    in order not to hinder the investigations, the police did not disclose the names of the individuals who were captured during the intelligence operation in southwestern bogota.    a police spokesman reported that the four men were arrested, following the 5 october arrest of a man who was carrying 15 kg of dynamite in a taxi.    shortly before that, another terrorist was nearly lynched by some people who captured him in northern bogota, after he placed an explosive device in a printshop.    a police patrol went to the site and prevented the private citizens and businessmen affected by the bombs from seriously harming the man who was, nonetheless, severely beaten.    the bogota police said that the arrest of these six terrorists in the last 24 hours aided in uncovering a plan to destroy an electrical generating center.    a police spokesman reported that the individuals were arrested, thanks to the cooperation of the people.  he emphasized that the quick reaction by a group of businessmen led to the arrest of one of the terrorists.    the second terrorist was arrested by the police after a taxi driver refused to provide service and reported him as a suspect.    when the suspect was interrogated, he disclosed information that allowed the police to locate a house in southern bogota where four men were hiding 250 kg of dynamite.    the terrorism affecting several colombian cities is the response from drug traffickers to colombian president virgilio barco who declared war on them in august.\n",

      "  according to a confidential peruvian military intelligence document published today by the lima daily la republica, the peruvian shining path guerrilla organization is planning to provoke a food shortage in lima.    according to the report, this alleged shining path strategy, based on the theory by the leader of the chinese revolution, mao zedong, \"of laying siege to the city from the countryside,\" is part of the terrorists' efforts to boycott the municipal elections of 12 november 1989 and, subsequently, the general and congressional elections of april 1990.    according to passages from the document published in la republica, the shining path \"has reportedly gained control over an important sector of lima's food supply and marketing network.\"    official sources have pointed out that farmer in the valleys of the peruvian coast area have been threatened by \"shining path people\" so that they neither harvest nor sell their products.  similar intimidating actions are also expected in the sierra valleys and the peruvian jungle area, the same sources noted.    peruvian military intelligence officials also expect the terrorists to take direct action within the next few days by burning the trucks that supply lima with foodstuffs.    this sabotage, the document points out, \"would be accompanied by massive actions against the electric power supply system aimed at reducing the refrigerated storage capacity of lima's main food suppliers.\"    the reports points out that the boycott of the municipal elections will be accompanied by a \"shining path\" call to hold a \"national armed stoppage\" for 12 november 1989, which will serve as a trial for similar actions in the april 1990 general elections.    elsewhere, a car bomb exploded last night in the town of barranca, lima department, close to where former education minister grover pango is staying.  four people were injured and property was damaged.    terrorist groups also blew up several high-voltage towers. a blackout was reported in barranca and neighboring towns.    according to a report published by la republica, the terrorist escalation began last friday (6 october) in lima and two policemen died in the town of cerro blanco.    in huancayo, the capital of junin department in the peruvian central sierra, the santa isabel high school has been the target of 10 bomb attacks over the past few days. the attacks have apparently been perpetrated by terrorists who have infiltrated themselves into the 5,000 santa isabel high school students.  only property damage has been reported as a result of the attacks.\n",

      "  the fmln has done nothing but insist on an immediate answer to all of this.  logically, i cannot say that their's is a serious position because when a number of documents are put forward, a period of time is required to analyze them.  however, the fmln immediately rejected the government's proposal, saying that it would not accept it.  what does this mean?  that the fmln no longer wants to talk about the end of the hostilities, but wants to introduce new topics at the san jose meeting.    however, despite the fmln's position, and although there has not been an in-depth study of all the documents, one can see at first glance that the proposals they have put forward are totally absurd.  i will cite an example: you know very well that the fmln has admitted to being unable to maintain a position, that if it attempts to occupy a town, in less than 24 hours the armed forces drive it out.  it cannot maintain a position in the country.  nevertheless, the fmln proposal attempts to establish territorial limits with the government.    while it is true that the fmln exists and is a reality, i believe that reality has a dimension, a size.  the results of the past elections, the results of something over 3 percent (won by the democratic convergence), indicate that the fmln is a reality but a very small one, and that it does not have the right to force a government and a people to violate their constitutional system.    meanwhile, the fmln has come up with the totally absurd notion that the government must dismiss the entire (military) class of '66, the defense minister, and the commander of the air force.  that is totally absurd, it is a ridiculous position that does not truly show any intention to movement toward peace.  the fmln proposal also calls for the government to instruct the legislative assembly to change all of the supreme court justices.  these, salvadoran friends, are totally absurd positions; although these are somewhat different, their previous positions are ever present.    the government will not at any time violate the constitution, it will never question the sacrifices that you and all the salvadoran people have made during these long years in order to gradually strengthen the democratic process, which may not be perfect -- and we would like to discuss different ways of perfecting it -- but we will never sell it or sacrifice it, especially under circumstances which, by all means, are absurd.    what is worse, however, is that along with the attitude the fmln has displayed in costa rica, along with its rejection of everything the government says, its attempts to modify the agenda we had agreed upon in mexico, its efforts to introduce a series of documents, and its demand for immediate answers, it has initiated a strategy of murders here in el salvador.  everyone has noticed; they murdered a reporter's wife and son.  why?  because they had a relative in the armed forces.  they have murdered an innocent young girl, at a safe distance, in a cowardly manner, only because she was a relative of  an armed forces member.  yesterday they attempted to murder a former military man who also has a relative in the armed forces.    what does all of this mean?  that the fmln intends to talk over there (costa rica) and to make an entire case out of its defending human rights, while murdering people and violating the human rights they claim to be defending, on a daily basis.  all of these fmln attitudes force us to dialogue, and as i said at the beginning, i must be completely clear and open.  i must tell the salvadoran people the truth.    i believe that so far the fmln has not displayed the political resolve to achieve peace.  first of all, the fmln does not want to talk about ending the conflict, it does not want to give the entire country -- you and i, my dear viewers -- the opportunity to stop living in this whirlpool of violence, to live in peace, and to allow the process to progress in the search for solutions that will gradually give us firm and lasting peace, within an atmosphere of tranquility.    the fmln's attitude is one of provocation.  it wants to provoke the government into getting up from the dialogue table; it has tried to anger the members of the commission by insulting them.  all in all, the fmln is trying to force the government to desist.  why are they seeking this?  because all they want is a little more image, the image that they have completely lost because their spaces have been closed. no one in the world will continue to justify an armed struggle.  that is a thing of the past.

      "  on the morning of 26 october the editorial office received telegrams from reuters and afp from the peruvian capital, which said that bombs had gone off the day before outside the soviet and prc embassies in lima.  our correspondent yevgeniy bay contacted vladimir kotov, head of the tass department in peru, by telephone and asked him for the details.    (kotov) according to the police, unidentified persons drove up to the soviet embassy building and planted a bomb under a car belonging to one of our diplomatic personnel.  they hardly had time to drive off before an explosion rang out.  one car was totally destroyed and three neighboring vehicles were damaged.  this happened at 2015 local time. and at 2030 hours a volkswagen parked near the entrance of the prc embassy exploded after being packed with dynamite.    fortunately, there are no casualties and no members of the diplomatic missions are hurt.  the buildings are not really damaged.    (bay) so far, according to the information agencies, none of the terrorist groups operating in the country have taken responsibility for this action, although the police suspect the extreme left-wing maoist organization, \"sendero luminoso.\"    (kotov) judging by the hallmark, it could quite well be.  as is well known, \"sendero luminoso\" has carried out several attacks on soviet missions and our citizens in the last 3 years.  many remember the incident when four unidentified people telephoned the soviet embassy -- allegedly to deliver some sort of package.  in the end, one of the terrorists got into the embassy grounds and, at that moment, the \"package\" exploded in his hands.  and several months ago (izvestiya reported this) terrorists planted a bomb under a bus in which soviet fishermen were traveling.    (bay) an extension of the state of emergency in the country has been announced in connection with the escalation in terrorist actions. how does the situation in the country look from where you stand?    (kotov) the state of emergency was introduced here in february 1986 and has been extended virtually every 30-60 days since then.  it is in effect in 35 percent of the country's territory, particularly in lima and the capitals of a number of departments.  however, the wave of terrorism is showing no sign of abating -- either on the part of the far right or the far left.  in october alone, their actions claimed 200 lives.    \"sendero luminoso\" is trying to intimidate the population and wreck the municipal elections planned for 12 november.  they have partially achieved their aim.  to the uninformed, peruvian statistics are simply horrifying: in the last 3 years, 64 mayors of various small and medium-sized towns in the andes have been killed.  naturally, there are few brave enough to take the risk of holding this post.    (bay) what kind of conditions are soviet representatives in peru living and working in?    (kotov) so far there have been no restrictions on our freedom of movement.  however, the escalation of terrorism naturally affects our wellbeing.  people live in a state of tension.  you expect something awful to happen at any moment.  you have to show the maximum caution everywhere: both at home and on the street.\n",

      "  colonel francisco elena fuentes, commander of the 1st infantry brigade, in analyzing recent acts of violence in san salvador, has reported that groups out of the control of the farabundo marti national liberation front - revolutionary democratic front (fmln -fdr) alliance could be responsible for the most recent acts of violence.    the military commander was careful in making his statement.  he said that he has no evidence that those groups are responsible for the explosions in the salvadoran workers national union federation (fenastras) and comadres (committee of mothers and relatives of the past, the army has been blamed, and later it has been discovered that fmln terrorists had carried them out.    elena fuentes recalled that a few days ago there was an explosion on the national university campus and he went there and it was established in front of student leaders that the explosion was caused by a grenade that went off in the hands of a young leftist who was handling it.  by then, however, statements had already been made accusing the military.    elena fuentes also referred to internal purges within communist groups, purges like the case of melida anaya montes, alias commander maria; salvador cayetano carpio, alias marcial; and others.    he said: \"it would not be strange to find that these actions have been the result of a purge or a diversionary tactic by the communists to attract political attention and gain the people's support, which everybody believes they are losing.\"    it was recalled, with all due respect, that the name of one of the victims of the fenastras attack, febe elizabeth velasquez, was mentioned in the investigations being carried out by international organizations over the embezzlement of aid from european countries that was to benefit the most needy people in our country, but that ended up in the hands of terrorist groups to be used for terrorist purposes.    elena fuentes stated: \"time and investigations will tell what really happened.\"    he said that the purpose of these attacks, especially the one on the defense ministry, for which the fmln - fdr claimed credit, as well as the attacks on comadres and fenastras, was to give the fmln - fdr leadership justification to withdraw from the dialogue.    elena fuentes said that the terrorist guadalupe martinez said in managua yesterday that the leftist leadership is considering not going to the dialogue meetings because of the attacks.\n",

      "  subunits of the peruvian ground forces and police, supported by armored personnel carriers, have conducted a major operation to arrest groups of armed extremists on the student campus of the san marcos state university. the operation took place after several terrorists broke into the building of the national industrialists society, where they set off three bombs causing extensive damage to the building.  after the attack the extremists fled to the university campus.    as a result of the operation around 100 students were arrested on suspicion of terrorist activity.  weapons, ammunition, and subversive literature were confiscated from some of them.    political terrorism has become part of everyday life in peru. recently a series of armed attacks has been carried out in various parts of the country by the extremist grouping sendero luminoso, which is trying to disrupt the municipal elections planned for 12 november. in tirapata village (puno department) a sendero luminoso detachment seized the local mayor and shot him in the central square in front of local residents who had been made to go there.  in the town of san clemente terrorists threw bombs at the homes of mayoral candidates from various political parties.  in the village of coris (ancash department) sendero luminoso fighters set fire to the telephone exchange and the municipal council and also took away the inhabitants' voting cards -- the main identification document in an election.  they threatened to deal with anyone who takes part in the municipal elections.    as a result of the extremists' threats around 90 mayoral candidates have withdrawn their nominations, as have hundreds of contenders for municipal council seats.\n",

      "  the salvadoran army said today that two \"attackers\" had lost their lives when they confronted soldiers after having \"robbed and raped\" the owner of a business in a city of western el salvador.  opposition sources, however, rejected this account and described the incident as \"murder.\"    juan jose martell, leader of the social christian people's movement (mpsc, opposition), rejected the military version and accused the army of \"murdering\" party leader cecilio rivera and two other party supporters.    the armed forces press committee said that rivera and apolinario alfaro -- the third person was not mentioned -- lost their lives when they confronted, along with four other men, troops of military detachment no.  6, in sonsonate, 65 km west of san salvador.    the military report added that the \"criminals\" had robbed a small shop, whose owner, maria teresa lopez, had been \"raped\" by the attackers.    martell said that the bodies of the (mpsc) members were found last night at the sonsonate cemetery along with a sign that read: \"because they betrayed the fatherland.\"    \"we have evidence that those responsible for rivera's murder and the two other (mpsc) supporters are soldiers of military detachment no. 6,\" martell stressed.    the (mpsc) is part of the leftist democratic convergence coalition, which took part in the 19 march presidential elections.    in another turn of events, the army has accused the guerrillas of kidnapping approximately 30 peasants in cuscatlan and santa ana departments, located to the north and west of san salvador, respectively.    meanwhile, the rebels stepped-up their sabotage against the electrical power grid by destroying two high-voltage pylons and seven power poles in guazapa, chalatenango, and ilobasco, locatede north and east of san salvador.\n",

      "  with just three days to go before the municipal elections scheduled for 12 november, terrorists have stepped up their violence and security forces have intensified their antisubversive operations in several peruvian regions.    shining path members last night bombed an office of the ruling american popular revolutionary alliance (apra) party in lima, injuring four people, one of them seriously.    during the attack the office was set on fire. an eyewitness said that some 150 electoral cards were burned. the cards, which are the only valid document for participation in the elections, had been taken to the party office so that the voting station could be defined.    police sources have reported at least six bombings last night in the andean city of ayacucho, 575 km southeast of the lima.  the sources, however, did not mention the buildings that were attacked.    on 7 november, shining path terrorists blew up 4 pylons in the vicinity of ayacucho, razing to 17 the number of pylons that have been blown up by this maoist organization in ayacucho and in zones of huancavelica department in the past few days.    a shining path \"elimination commando\" murdered a national police commander on 7 november in the residential lima district of miraflores.  the police have reported a power outage in towns of the huaylas valley, in the mountainous region of the northern department of ancash, following the destruction of two pylons.    in one of the towns -- ranrahirca -- the sources said that the shining path members set the city hall facility on fire, destroying valuable documents.  in la oroya, junin department, in the central peruvian mountain range, public buildings were bombed and a car-bomb was detonated.    reports received from ayacucho and from other rural areas say that terrorists are stopping vehicles in highways and that they are stripping passengers of their electoral cards, which they then destroy.    in view of this escalation of violence, the government on 7 november decreed a state of emergency in the 10 provinces of the department of lima, placing them under military control.  this is the peruvian department with the largest population and with the largest number of voters.  it has more than 6,000,000 people, and includes the port of callao.    on 6 november, the military authorities imposed a curfew between 1000 and 0500 in the departments of junin and pasco in the central mountain range.  the same measure has already been enforced in ayacucho, apurimac, and huancavelica.    the political-military command of the ayacucho emergency zone last night issued a communique enforcing strict measures that will be observed by the people during the elections.    the communique states that as of 13 november, those electoral card that do not bear the seal that is stamped at the voting stations and which proves that the bearer has cast his vote will be arrested and \"placed at the disposal of the courts.\"    it adds that if someone wants to travel,to make administrative arrangements, to obtain documents, or to perform commercial transactions, they will have to show their electoral card with the corresponding seal, under penalty of being forbidden to proceed.    during a press conference yesterday, the technical police presented 27 alleged shining path members who were captured in southern lima provinces and in ica. they are charged with being involved in at least 40 attacks and murders of authorities, and with planning future attacks against electoral offices and candidates in the upcoming municipal elections.    combined military and police forces yesterday raided the san fernando school of medicine of the lima university of san marcos, arresting 600 persons and seizing explosives and propaganda material.    on 6 november, during a search of the san marcos university campus in lima, the police seized firearms, explosives, and terrorist propaganda material.\n",

      "  nine hours after a series of attacks were launched simultaneously by the salvadoran guerrillas in different parts of the capital, one can still hear the explosions of powerful bombs, the strafing of rebel positions by air force helicopters, and heavy rifle fire.    a high-powered bomb shook the afp offices in san salvador a few minutes ago.  it is just before daybreak, 0500 on sunday morning. from the windows, one can see that the helicopters are dropping flares before firing to better locate their targets.    urban cells of the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) attacked at least 10 military positions in the capital at 2000 on saturday night, and the attacks are apparently continuing this morning.    in addition to attacking military positions, the rebels also launched simultaneous attacks on the presidential palace, president alfredo cristiani's private home, the home of ricardo alvarenga, president of the congress, and the installations of the central electoral council.    air force helicopter gunships are still firing at alleged guerrilla positions, primarily in the northern part of san salvador.  an exchange of rifle fire has also intensified.  the noise can be heard throughout the capital, where citizens are experiencing the worst anxiety of the past few years of civil war in el salvador.    on a national radio network, the armed forces urged the people not to leave their homes before 0600 (1200 gmt).    despite the intensity of the fighting, the army has not yet reported on casualties on either side.    a military spokesman said over the radio network that the military units have surrounded the last rebel strongholds in ayutuxtepeque, in the northern part of san salvador.    in ciudad delgado, also on the northern side, \"heavy fighting is continuing, but our units are bringing the situation under control,\" the military spokesman said over the radio network.    important sectors of the city remain dark because the guerrillas sabotaged several electric pylons at the same time that they launched the attacks on the military positions.    colonel rene emilio ponce, chairman of the armed forces joint staff, last week noted what he described as a \"pre-insurrectional stage\" on the part of the fmln, primarily in urban areas.    violence broke out on saturday morning, when guerrilla urban commands launched a mortar attack on the national guard headquarters in the capital.  two children and eight other people (three soldiers and five civilians) were wounded.\n",

      "  ...government against our embassy worsened.  this campaign was initiated at the highest levels of the salvadoran government.  on various occasions over the past 8 days, television, press, and radio have systematically broadcast statements by el salvador's top military and political authorities, president cristiani, vice president merino, and the head of arena (nationalist republican alliance), etc, blaming nicaragua for what is happening in el salvador.    this campaign has been systematic and it has encouraged terrorist groups to threaten the lives and safety of nicaragua's diplomatic representatives.  over the past few days, i have received many death threats from extremist sectors and, i repeat, this led the nicaraguan government to the decision to evacuate us.    this does not mean that diplomatic relations between the two countries are broken.  it is a precautionary measure to ensure the entire mission's physical safety.  we requested diplomatic protection from the mexican government and received a positive response.  we went today from the residence of the mexican ambassador in el salvador to the airport, and from there to managua.    if you have any questions, i will be glad to answer them.    (reporter) a question from radio sandino.  first of all, since you got a first- hand view, what is the current situation in el salvador; second, is this a provisional measure or will it be extended; how long will this measure last?    (lacayo) i cannot say how long it will last.  that is up to the government, and it will depend on the internal situation in the country.  regarding your first question, the situation is difficult. on a military level, the war continues; there is a good deal of misinformation by the salvadoran government and many international news agencies.  the truth is that the battle continues, there has been considerable physical destruction in many towns and neighborhoods on the outskirts of san salvador.  you know which towns are included: zacamil, ciudad delgado, soyapango, etc. this is the result of the indiscriminate bombings by the salvadoran air force.    (reporter) there is a report that somozist guards are fighting with the salvadoran army.  is there anything to this?    (lacayo) there are rumors to that effect.  some insurgent radio stations have reported it, and they have also mentioned troops from other central american governments.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) yes, but not with the persistence that prevails now.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) of course.  many telephone calls, surveillace by suspicious individuals and vehicles at the residence throughout the day, and especially direct threats by telephone.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) i would imagine they are salvadoran rightwing extremists, better known as death squads.  they began to selectively shoot people. there is the case of mrs norma girola de herrera, president of the womens institute, a very progressive institution.  mrs herera was very well known, and she was murdered under circumstances very similar to those of the assasination of the jesuits; on the same day.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo( i do not have any more information because of the city's militarization.  a state of siege has been implemented, the circulation of vehicles is minimal, communication is sparse, telephones are tapped.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) yes, that has been proven.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) they are waging a war which consists at times of maintaining positions, at other times of mobilizing.  on several occasions controlled areas ceased to be controlled but the war continues.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) no, i do not know.  the government did that directly through the foreign ministry.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) no, because we did not know.  however, the truth is that we never had protection.  we never had police protection at the residence although it was requested through the foreign ministry.  the embassy had two policemen, but during this period they left and the embassy is without police protection.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) that has been said about guatemala and honduras.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) as a report and in the press.

      "  commander roberto roca, the repercussions of the jesuits' (words indistinct) were not long in coming.  one of the most significant ones was the editorial of an important u.s.  newspaper, the new york times, on 18 november.  the editorial says, among other things, that if president alfredo cristiani does not order a quick, thorough, and genuine investigation to catch the assassins, he might lose the united states' economic aid.    the editorial also states the democrats in congress have said that the military aid should be suspended if el salvador cannot control and punish the death squads.  they add that if he does not heed the warning, the next statement might be issued by both parties.  what are the implications of this important statement by an influential u.s. newspaper for cristiani's government and the salvadoran armed forces?    (roca) actually, the new york times states the feeling pervading the entire united states.  it is a way of confirming that the fascist groups prevail within the government and arena (nationalist republican alliance), and they are deciding the regime's policies. political opinion in the united states has undoubtedly been shaken by this massacre planned by alfredo cristiani's government.    we believe that u.s. politicians will progressively come to support the u.s. people's feelings and will demand that cristiani's government order the investigation.  we know that this will not be easy in el salvador, because, as the editorial points out, similar assassinations have been perpetrated innumerable times.  these cases have been surrounded by absolute secrecy; no culprits are found; and witnesses have testified many times that the actions were carried out by armed forces members, either dressed as civilians or in uniform.  however, the policy of the armed forces and the government protects the culprits.    we believe that this civilian assassination, meaning the assassination of the jesuit priests, the fact that practically all the leaders of the labor movement were sought out that same night to be killed, plus the fact that the killing of the cooperative members was carried out within the framework of the great battles being fought in el salvador's urban areas, will eventually convince u.s.  politicians that the government they have been supporting is clearly a fascist government which has absolutely no interest in any kind of democratic consolidation.

      "  san salvador, 19 nov (acan-efe) -- salvadoran clergymen from the catholic, lutheran, and baptist churches have claimed that they are being \"persecuted\" by groups operating in the country in the style of the ultrarightist \"death squads\"    medardo gomez, a lutheran church bishop, said today that clergymen are subject to \"persecution.\"  he said that members of the police force are \"besieging\" shelters established by the religious groups to benefit thousands of victims of the fighting.    the lutheran bishop said that six germans, four u.s. citizens, a canadian, and a spaniard were arrested by the treasury police 2 days ago in a church in san salvador, where the troops were looking for \"guerrilla collaborators.\"    the foreigners were detained after having helped to aid civilians who took refuge in churches in san salvador after fleeing from the bloody clashes between the military and rebels in the mejicanos, cuscatancingo, zacamil, ciudad delgado, san jacinto, and soyapango neighborhoods, located in the northern and northeastern parts of the capital.    several priests, including daniel lopez, a spaniard, had to evacuate their parishes, which are located in the embattled areas, after the churches were surrounded by soldiers.  lopez had to leave the santa maria de los pobres church in the la chacra slum area in eastern san salvador after it was bombed by the air force, according to one of lopez' assistants, who is also a spaniard.    religious sources told the press that treasury policemen assaulted some 50 refugees in the san roque shelter, located in southern san salvador, when they were searching for a priest named cortez.    the religious leaders said that the persecution was stepped up after the start of the guerrilla offensive in the capital, which began on 11 november and so far has left some 1,000 dead, including 6 jesuit priests who were assassinated.

      "  eduardo colorado, attorney general of el salvador, stated today that there is a plan, possibly prepared by the guerrillas, to attack salvadoran bishops and \"create greater problems for the government\" of alfredo cristiani.    in a news conference, the official said that \"it would be advisable for the bishops to leave the country or not appear in public.\"    colorado, who did not want want to provide further details about the alleged plan, said that the main target might be msgr gregorio rosa chavez, auxiliary bishop of san salvador, since several of his relatives are guerrillas.    the attorney general did not rule out the possibility that persons who have lost relatives in the war \"might carry out the plan\" that \"might be organized by the terrorists to create a greater crises for the government.\"    the attorney general said he sent a letter to pope john paul ii asking him to remove from the country the bishops who reportedly support the so-called \"people's church.\"  according to colorado, this \"people's church\" is responsible in part for the violence in the country.    he did not specify which bishops are mentioned in the letter sent to the pope, but various sources insist he is referring to archbishop arturo rivera y damas and auxiliary bishop rosa chavez, who support a political solution to the conflict in the country.    in the letter, the attorney general suggests that pope john paul ii remove these salvadoran bishops since, he insists, \"it is 1,000 times better to prevent these incidents than to have to investigate them.\"    the attorney general's letter to the pope was sent 2 days after six jesuits (five spaniards and one salvadoran) and two women were killed in san salvador by a group of 30 to 40 men wearing military uniforms, according to witnesses.\n",

      "  just a few minutes ago two very strong explosions occurred in the center of bogota.  we felt these explosions here at the rcn (radio cadena nacional) building. one of the explosions occurred in the vicinity of the courts in the palo quemado sector, where all the bogota judicial branch offices are located. apparently the other explosion occurred in a street near the presidential palace.    there were two explosions occurring consecutively but very close together, which is why it was felt so strongly.  it initially felt like an earthquake: first the wave and then the explosion.  all the residents in this central area of bogota felt it.    it is also said that the explosion could have occurred closer to the administrative department of security, das, which is located in the same area.  the das headquarters are just around the corner from the judicial branch offices in palo quemado.  the strong explosion that was felt by all of us who work at this hour in the central bogota area took place at 19th carrera and 25th street in palo quemado.  i repeat, two consecutive explosions occurred at 0735 in the center of bogota.    here is some updated information: it was not two explosions, as we had intially believed, but three explosions that occurred a few minutes ago in bogota. one of them was in the palo quemado sector, as we have already reported, in the area where both the bogota courts and das are located.  another explosion occurred in the southern part of bogota at 14th carrera and 28th street south, apparently near an agrarian trust branch in the barrio gustavo restrepo neighborhood.  a third explosion occurred in the central area of bogota.  these three explosions in bogota took place almost simultaneously, just a few seconds apart.    we now have official figures of the explosion near the das headquarters: seven persons were killed, more than 50 were wounded, and approximately 25 vehicles and at least 15 buildings -- including the das offices that were partially destroyed -- were damaged. initially, das officials have estimated that a powerful bomb of more than 100 kg of dynamite placed in a truck was activated.    the huge explosion caused the initial destruction of the front part of the das headquarters, as well as a building where there was a hardware store, and the total destruction of six or seven other buildings.  a crater 15 meters wide and 6 meters deep was created in 27th carrera.    most of the victims of the explosion were in private vehicles and taxis, and only four were walking in the area when the explosion occurred at almost 0740.  officials say initially that there were 50 persons, hit by glass shards and flying pieces of vehicles, injured in the explosion.  officials have indicated that it is possible that the number of victims will increase, as the attack against the das headquarters was very strong.  we repeat: officially, seven persons were killed here in front of the das headquarters.\n",

      "  ...the offensive of the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) as of 11 november has been militarily defeated here in the city of san salvador, as well as in san miguel, usulutan, and zacatecoluca, where there was greater activity by the subversives.  logically, after being rejected so much, after having lost so many figthers and war materiel, they do not have the capability to again launch an operation like they did on 11 november.  they will continue with indiscriminate terrorism and selective terrorism.  we have here some of the first evidence. for example, the murder of a person useful to salvadoran society like dr guerrero, the acts of sabotage against the electricity system, the destruction of public transportation.  we can also mention the destruction of some gasoline stations.  basically, what they seek is to systematically destroy the economy of the country, to provoke the closing of some industrial centers, and to bring about economic chaos.    that is why, even though we believed we were taking risks in the military field of national defense, the armed forces changed the curfew hours, so that curfew hours are now from 2300 to 0500.  we did this believing that the economic aspect is very important for the country, and that is why we want to benefit the industrial, business, and farming sectors, so that they will be able to carry out their activities under almost normal conditions.    we also considered that this time of the year we are picking coffee and cotton and harvesting sugarcane, and these are the three main staples of our economy.  these activities are mainly carried out in the evening, and that is why we have changed the curfew hours to benefit businessmen, workers, and farmers so they can support their families.    (reporter) colonel, does the president think that during the costa rican meeting enough pressure can be exerted on nicaragua so that it will suspend assistance to the fmln and the war will diminish in the country?    (ponce) the cynicism of the dictator ortega of the sandinist government has been fully proven.  in the previous meetings within the framework of esquipulas ii, he committed himself to discontinuing support for the fmln.  this total war offensive that has been inflicted upon the salvadoran people should be suspended, because we are sure that the moment nicaragua and cuba -- it is through those countries, rather those governments that the communist bloc has been helping the fmln -- the fmln would weaken tremendously.  (sentence as heard)    as a member of the armed forces, as a member of the high command, i feel very proud about the professional, determined, and courageous attitude with which the officers, non-commissioned officers, and troops of our armed forces have neutralized and defeated the fmln offensive.  in this regard, i believe that the opinions voiced by general thurman are not really in line with what we have lived here inside the country.

      "  compatriots, as you know, i came to japan to fulfill a mission in this country, which has always expressed its solidarity with colombia.    i have been, however, closely following the country's situation with deep sadness and indignation after the criminal attack on the das (administrative department of security) facilities, which deeply shook all colombians.    i have been in constant touch with carlos lemos simmons, the minister designated to act on my behalf and with my closest assistants.    in the past few days, we have experienced an increase in the vile attacks carried out by the drug trafficking criminal organization. those attacks have taken the life of many innocent colombians.  men, women, and children, who were in the prime of their lives, have been sacrificed by mad actions carried out by criminals, who intend to control an entire people, government, and country through terror and destruction.    they will not defeat us.  we are and will continue struggling.  the war has been declared on the entire country and on democracy.  we will not fall under the control of the narcoterrorists' bloody tyranny.    last night, the country learned about the colombian chamber of representatives's decision to approve the constitutional reforms with the inclusion of the extradition issue in the referendum.    the confirmation that the avianca plane crash was caused by a bomb; the murder of bernardo jaramillo uribe, roving 13th judge of criminal investigation; and this morning's atrocious attack on the das facilities further proves that the decision made by the chamber of representatives is highly unsuitable for the entire country.    we absolutely cannot accept drug traffickers trying to force our legislators to adopt a decision that would only bring more destruction and death to colombia, because if the inclusion of the extradition issue is approved in the referendum, it would not be a decision made by the sovereign will of the people, but by the force of bullets and terror.    colombians have unfortunately paid too high a price to find out what these criminals really think.  they spoke about a truce and then they murdered a judge.  subsequently, the chamber of representatives approved the inclusion of the extradition issue into the referendum and, in good faith, many people thought that was the first step toward peace with the drug traffickers.  they were wrong.  the next day the das facilities were attacked.    those actions prove what those criminals are capable of doing to obtain a favorable decision in the referendum.  they do not conduct an election campaign, but a campaign of terror to attain their goals.    i now reiterate what i said in my speech before leaving for japan. i said that the constitutional reforms with the inclusion of the referendum is highly unsuitable.    i share the sorrow and sadness of all my compatriots, especially victims' relatives.  our indignation must represent all colombians' intention to join efforts and drop personal interests.    compatriots, we must never, we will never succumb to the narcoterrorists.  the stable democracy we have built and defended with great effort for over 1 century is endangered.  throughout its history, colombia has overcome more difficult times.  let us all stand up with faith, courage, and firmness to defend our homeland and freedom.  thank you very much.\n",

(begin recording) (barco) approximately 2 weeks ago an airplane exploded when taking off from bogota, and experts who came from many parts of the world have discovered that it was caused by a bomb placed on board rather than a problem of pressurization.    the other case is the attack which was perpetrated last night, 2 nights ago, against the intelligence headquarters of the national police.  you have read or reported that a large amount... (changes thought) about 500 kg of dynamite placed in a truck exploded and caused the collapse or considerable damage of the general headquarters of the colombian intelligence services.    the terrorist attack was perpetrated against the offices of the das, which is -- as i said before -- where the most important intelligence activities against organized crime and drug trafficking are carried out.

(words indistinct) and air support against our positions.  we are awaiting detailed reports of this attack on the general staff with 60-mm mortars.    simultaneously, our guerrilla columns in san salvador established positions in san benito, escalon, la mascota, and maquiliguat neighborhoods, and also in san antonio abad and the northern periphery of the general staff installations, battling with marines, military detachment no. 7 from aguachapan, the elite battalions stationed there, national police forces, and units from the san benito battalion, which is in charge of guarding the general staff installations.  it is reported that one m-16 rifle, pistols, military equipment, and a large quantity of ammunition were seized from the army.    at 0100, our antiaircraft units opened fire on two helicopters in escalon neighborhood.  one of them was a transport helicopter and the other a gunship.  both were damaged.  meanwhile, our guerrillas also used mortars during an attack on the san benito battalion's positions near zona rosa.  at the same time, an attack was carried out against the cetipol (police instruction center) police academy in santa tecla, using 81-mm mortars.  attacks were staged against the cetipol's peripheral defense from another direction until late this morning.    meanwhile, an attack carried out from the northern part of san salvador led to incursions in soyapango, mejicanos, and ayutuxtepeque. in ayutuxtepeque the fmln carried out annihilation maneuvers against the 1st infantry brigade's soriano battalion, which was stationed on el carmen hill where we killed 15 soldiers and wounded 30.  among these casualties is an officer from the 1st infantry brigade.    the fmln seized five m-16 rifles, one (word indistinct) grenade launcher, (words indistinct), four m-60 machineguns from the annihilated troops.  a military vehicle was partially destroyed, and an enemy patrol was totally destroyed.    pral (long-range reconnaissance patrol) reinforcement units attempted to support the army troops under attack but they were repelled by the fmln.    the electricity system in different parts of the capital city was sabotaged, leaving 90 percent of the city without power.    attention.  here is the report on the helicopter downed in soyapango.  attention.  on 6 december there were clashes in san jose cortez, jurisdiction of soyapango, with the belloso battalion which received strong aerial support up until the afternoon hours. helicopters machinegunned and rocketed this densely populated area. our antiaircraft units, reaffirming our determination to defend the civilian population against aerial attacks, opened fire and hit a gunship.  the gunship fell to the ground at the morazan tobacco company.    guerrilla units simultaneously attacked paramilitary forces in tonacatepeque during the early hours of 7 december, which prompted aerial support because this area is on the air force's security perimeter, but calls from the battalion that was being annihilated on the el carmen hill in ayutuxtepeque went unheeded.    these are the first reports on all the activities under way in san salvador, where at 2200 on 6 december our guerrilla units began to force and break the dam that the high command built at the general staff's bunker (words indistinct) our columns, until they penetrated the aforementioned areas, fighting in the escalon and san benito neighborhoods where the oligarchs live.    actions have also taken place throughout the country.  factories have been sabotaged, strategic highways have been controlled, positions have been established, and towns have been occupied.  we will furnish further information later.\n",

      "  many political, union, university, religious, and civic organizations have been \"beheaded\" by the offensive launched by the salvadoran guerrillas a month ago, by the army's response to the offensive, and by extremist groups' retaliatory actions.    these organizations -- most of which actively favored a political solution to the salvadoran war -- have been left without main leaders because, according to party members and supporters, they have been killed, forced to hide or leave the country for \"security reasons\"    the jesuit central american university's (uca) main leaders were murdered.  according to religious organization sources, approximately 50 priests -- salvadoran and foreigners -- have left the country because they felt \"persecuted\" by the army which links them to the guerrillas.    the editorial of the 15 december edition of \"proceso\" -- a uca weekly publication -- asserts that the murder of the six jesuits on uca premises on 16 november, occurred at the same time when several churches and union headquarters were being searched by \"people in uniforms.\"    \"proceso\" mantains that \"apparently, they wanted to strike one single blow and behead every organization labeled by government propaganda as an fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) facade.\"    however, salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said before he left to attend a central american presidential summit in costa rica, that his government does not persecute religious leaders.    three days after the guerrillas started their largest offensive in the decade -- on 14 november -- guillermo ungo and hector oqueli, the main leftist opposition leaders, left el salvador, saying that they had received death threats in messages broadcast over the government's radio network.    leaders of the general confederation of workers (cgt) -- which is linked to the christian democratic party -- have reported that they are being persecuted and blame the army and the guerrillas for \"violating human rights.\"    cgt leader jose luis grande preza asserted that \"to recuperate and mantain their privileges, the extreme rightists have unscrupulously turned the army against its own people and generated repression and persecution against the church, the opposition, and union movements.\"    before leaving for guatemala to obtain support for a cease-fire in el salvador, grande preza said the guerrillas \"violate human rights in the name of revolution\" and that \"each side justifies its violence, but the only truth is that the people always end up burying the dead.\"    ludovico samayoa, deputy of the main opposition christian democratic party (pdc), asserted that two pdc municipal officials in ilobasco had been arrested by army members in the past few days. ilobasco is located 60 km northeast of san salvador.    \"the government has initiated a generalized repression to dismantle the party and frighten our members with these arrests,\" said samayoa.    human rights commission coordinator miguel montenegro said that his office, as well as other offices of organizations that oppose the government, \"were searched and destroyed by bombs\" in the eastern city of san miguel.    ignacio ellacuria, one of the six jesuits murdered on 16 november, founder of \"proceso\" and uca director, had noted a few months before his death that \"the salvadoran political process had entered a new phase of moderation and flexibility with the increase of political spaces.\"    in contrast the editorial that appears in the next edition of \"proceso\" stresses: \"it is the hour of the long knives.  the malestrom of blood that has come upon the country in the past month has shred to pieces the phase of moderation in which the main participants of the salvadoran political process had been involved.\"\n",

      "  from 10 to 12 december, presidents of five central american countries held a special meeting to mediate between the salvadoran government and guerrillas.  but so far no agreement has been reached by both sides on bringing about a cease-fire during christmas.  their 1-month-long fierce battle has left 3,000 people dead and also cast a shadow over the central american peace process.    the current civil war in el salvador was triggered off by the destruction of the headquarters of the labor federation, the country's biggest trade union organization.  on 31 october, an ultrarightist \"dare-to-die squad\" supported by the government and the military used a heavy bomb to bombard the headquarters building of the labor federation, killing and wounding over 40 people including principal leaders of the federation.  on 2 november, the guerrillas issued a statement strongly condemning the terrorist activity of the squad and declaring the cancellation of the third round of talks with the government scheduled in venezuela.  on the same night the guerrillas launched a large-scale offensive \"to eliminate fascism.\"  about 8,000 guerrillas swiftly captured many towns and strategic positions northwest of the capital and cut key communications lines between the capital and the hinterland.  in the meantime, they also attacked some 50 government army bases and police stations in the hinterland, thus controlling 30 percent of the country's territory.  they have established \"local people's governments\" in 8 of the 14 provinces throughout the country.  during this period, the government dispatched armored cars and air force units to carry out counterattacks.  they wantonly bombarded the residential areas near the capital city occupied by the guerrillas.  after 8 days of fierce battle, the guerrillas shot down 12 government fighter planes and helicopters; destroyed 34 tanks, armored cars, and patrol cars; and captured a large amount of arms and ammunition.  subsequently battles continued in regions outside the capital city.  since early december both sides have engaged in fierce battles in the capital city and the hinterland. the guerrillas used mortars to attack the building of the government army general staff headquarters, the u.s.  embassy, and the presidential restaurant, whereas the government army dispatched planes to bombard the guerrilla positions.  fierce battles have also broken out in chalatenango, san miguel, and other towns, thereby causing heavy casualties and property losses.    this war has deep-rooted causes.  el salvador is a small country with an area of 21,000 square km and a population of 5 million. during this 10-year-long war, 70,000 people have died and the national economy has been seriously destroyed.  the ultrarightist nationalist republican alliance (arena) won the general election early this year, thus aggravating the conflict between the guerrillas and the government.  prior to the election, the guerrillas put forward a peace proposal demanding six months' posponement of the election so as to make their participation possible.  but this proposal was rejected by the government.  because almost half of the voters did not vote, the guerrillas declared it did not recognize the cristiani government. pressed by domestic public opinion and urged by the central american peace agreement, the government and the guerrillas held two rounds of talks in september and october.  during their talks the guerrillas demanded that the government stop its suppression, introduce political, economic, and judicial reforms, reorganize the armed forces, and punish the \"dare-to-die squad.\"  the government insisted that the guerrillas should lay down their arms before reforms were carried out.  the hard-line position of the government reflected the established policy of the ruling party, which has all along stood for ruling the country by military means, advocated the suppression of democratic forces, and supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in carrying out assassination.  a university president in central america was assassinated by the squad for criticizing the ultrarightist policy of the ruling party.  recently the ruling party supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in attacking the labor federation's building. this ignited the current civil war and undermined the peace process in the country. the guerrillas issued a statement on 12 december condemning the meeting of the five heads of state for being partial to the ultrarightist salvadorian government.  they made it clear that they would not accept any effort to dissolve the guerrilla forces and would carry on their struggle.

      "  the police have reported that tomas evangelista, a leader of the ruling american popular revolutionary alliance (apra) and director of the ayacucho development corporation, was shot dead by terrorists here today.    the police said that a group of hooded individuals early this morning entered evangelista's house and, after tying the hands of his wife and five children, took evangelista out of the house and shot him at least 20 times.    evangelista, who was 50 years old, had held the most important regional apra posts for 30 years.    evangelista's wife told the police that before her husband was killed, the hooded man shouted their support for the pro-maoist shining path terrorist group.  anthropologist abimael guzman, the founder of the shining path terrorist organization, was evangelista's professor at the huamanga university in ayacucho.    the national police have also reported that on 26 january shining path terrorists murdered brothers martiza and john paolo puzo ochoa and their mother marta ochoa in the township of campina, 60 km south of ayacucho.    witnesses told the police that the ochoas were killed because they refused to supply food and lodging to the terrorists.    more than 200 people have died so far this month owing to the armed struggle that the shining path terrorists began in 1980 and that has already claimed the lives of at least 17,700 people and caused damage of over $16 billion, which is the equivalent to the 70 percent of the peruvian foreign debt.\n",

      "  we are saying hello at this hour to north santander governor eduardo assaf elcure.  dr assaf, good day.    (assaf) good morning, rcn (station call sign).    (reporter) mr. governor, what information does the departmental administration have about events dealing with public order, such as regrettable incident in arboledas (murder of arboledas mayor pedro jesus hernandez).    (assaf) the official reports on the regrettable case in arboledas at noon today, and those carried by rcn and other stations, describing the way in which mayor pedro jesus hernandez was murdered while inaugurating a dining hall for children at juan bueno, arboledas municipality, lead us to believe that something extremely serious is happening.  hernandez was going to inaugurate on 20-25 february four or five works that are important for the development of the communities and had been demanded by them for a long time.  this leads us to believe that the situation is really difficult and that other measures will have to be adopted to prevent a continuation of these regrettable actions, which destabilize public order in the department.    i think that after the peace talks with m-19 (19 april movement) are concluded next week, dr. octavio pardo should in some way promote a truce with the national liberation army (eln) and the epl (popular liberation army) to see if it is possible to begin a dialogue and keep the bloodshed from continuing in our country, most particularly in our department.  over the course of a month, two mayors, who were characterized as the fightingest mayors -- in the sense that they launched, executed, and completed works -- have been killed in our department.    (reporter) mr. governor, how many mayors did you say have been killed during that time?    (assaf) what did you say?    (repoerter) mr. governor, do you believe that, for instance, civic or political leaders in the area of north santander can participate in talks with the epl and the eln to make serious proposals to the government about a possible truce, as you suggest?    (assaf) in view of our current situation, that is, in view of the fact that a month ago the mayor of abrego was killed and the arboledas mayor was killed yesterday, i believe that the country is pleased that the pacification process with m-19 will end this week.  so, why not look for avenues of communication with the (1-second break in reception) and the epl to establish a truce, at least during this electoral period, so that all colombians, especially those of north santander, can freely exercise their sovereign right to participate in an election and express their satisfaction with or condemnation of the people who are currently governing the municipalities?

      "  defense minister gen. hector alejandro gramajo spoke on 7 february at a news conference just a few hours after learning of a new guerrilla attack that took place at daybreak on 7 february, against the tecpan, chimaltenango police garrison. the guerrillas stole four .38 caliber revolvers, four m-1 carbines, and .30 caliber ammunition and took police patrol car no.  ch-02.    during wednesday's news conference, the army released a summary of guerrilla activities starting in early december, when subverisve commandos destroyed the bridge spanning the coyolate river.  during a four-day period in december, the guerrillas sabotaged an electrical tower outside the capital and set fire to a vehicle belonging to the technical-agricultural training institute on the road to solola.    two more acts of sabotage against electrical installations took place the first week in january.  a few days later, three government-owned vehicles were set on fire -- one belonging to bandesa (national agriculrural development bank) and two belonging to the public health ministry, which were transporting vaccines to a clinic. during the last days of january, there was another act of sabotage against the electrical system in quezaltenango and an attack on the village of pochuta that caused personal injuries and property damage.    since the weekend, a post at the kilometer 42 road mark along route ca-9 was attacked and a civilian was killed.  at daybreak on 14 february, the national police garrison at tecpan, chimaltenango was attacked, but no casualties were reported.    according to the minister of defense, the leftist guerrillas' new directives came from a recent meeting held in a central american country, which the military commander did not identify.

(end recording)    according to gen. gramajo, some rivalries have started among the different guatemalan national revolutionary unity (urng) groups, such is the case of the rebel armed forces (far) who have penetrated areas were the revolutionary organization of the people in arms (orpa) operated, such as the areas of pachlum, peten, and godinez.  orpa now maintains itself south of chimaltenango, in the northern area of escuintla and sacatepequez.  the poor people's guerrilla army (egp) centers its actions against bases.    the defense minister also explained the army's position concerning the possibility of reinitiating talks with guerrilla representatives.    (begin recording) (gramajo) as you may have noticed, we only refer to the three groups in which they operate.  however, we are only talking about armed activities.  the constitution says that there cannot be armed bands and (words indistinct) in combat zones.  (words indistinct) euphemisms: dialogue, talks, and conferences.  this, however, is not a matter that concerns us.  we have been very clear in this sense.  we have serious reservations about the validity of a conference, or talks, or whatever that has only been used as a tactical instrument at a specific moment.  el salvador has suffered much in this regard.

      "  salvadoran president alfredo cristiani today said the government is awaiting a reply from the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) regarding a possible resumption of the dialogue.    cristiani held a news conference at the comalapa airport this morning prior to traveling to taiwan on a tour which, he said, will last until 3 march.    cristiani disclosed that as part of his mediation efforts, the un secretary general has twice sent his personal delegate, alvaro de soto, who has been told that the salvadoran government demands that the fmln halt its hostilities and sabotage activity aimed at disrupting national commerce.    \"we know,\" president cristiani said, \"that the fmln has asked for two weeks to study and respond to our latest proposal.\"    the president referred to an attack last night and early this morning on an electric power substation in northwestern san salvador, describing it as \"a publicity ploy to impress the un secretary general.\"    \"we are insisting on a halt to hostilities\" because of such actions, which \"constitute only terrorism and do not represent a military threat,\" the president said.    the president denied that the government is looking for economic aid in other regions because of the suspension of frg aid and because of the possibility of u.s. aid cuts.    \"this visit to taiwan had been scheduled since before the guerrilla offensive in november.  i received the invitation from the taiwan government when i took office in june,\" cristiani said.    he added that the objective of the visit is to strengthen relations and trade with a friendly government as well as to express thanks for the technical assistance taiwan has provided.    regarding aid from the frg, he said \"efforts are being made to reestablish it.  the frg government is conditioning its aid on respect for human rights and the development of the democratic process in the country.\"    referring to u.s. aid, the salvadoran president said he is not aware that official decisions or plans exist.  instead, there are personal positions of congressmen or special-interest groups, but this must be fully discussed at the time of the vote for the next fiscal year, which in the united states begins in october.    the president also defended the recent economic measures, which have led to protests against the general increase in prices of staples.  he said these measures were necessary for the country's economy, which was affected last year, first, by the overall cuts in u.s. aid to the region, a reduction of $55 million for el salvador; second, by the drop in international coffee prices, which caused $150 million in losses for el salvador; and third, by the damage from the guerrilla offensive in november.    before leaving on his trip and in response to newsmen's questions, president cristiani also defended the armed forces, stating that the actions in which they have been involved recently have not weakened them and, on the contrary, have strengthened the armed forces because errors have been admitted and those responsible are being prosecuted, such as in the cases of the jesuits and the civilians who were killed on 11 february in chalatenango.    cristiani said that in the latter case there have been no pressures and that from the moment that there was news about the tragedy, the commission that investigates criminal acts was ordered to undertake the appropriate investigation to determine the cause of the tragedy. he said it concluded that the tragedy was caused by a helicopter rocket, but there was no bombing, although the civilians were victims of war actions.    cristiani criticized the fmln for waging battles in populated areas because this endangers civilians.    in conclusion, cristiani said the fmln will never give up its attempts to weaken or divide the armed forces, but he added that the armed forces are becoming more professional every day.\n",

      "  bush met on 15 february in cartagena de indias (colombia) with his counterparts alan garcia of peru, jaime paz of bolivia, and virgilio barco of colombia in what became known as the \"drug summit.\"    u.s. priest francisco amico ferrari, kidnapped on 15 february in cali, was released on 19 february by the eln with a message about \"operation colombia,\" which denounces u.s. intervention in the \"dirty war\" with which colombia is afflicted.    in today's communique the guerrillas say \"the united states has military advisers in the colombian army headquarters to direct the implementation of the dirty war.\"    they also denounce \"the direct leadership of u.s. advisers in intelligence and military repression operations in the areas of conflict.\"    the eln is also still holding social conservative senator jorge sedano gonzalez, kidnapped on 9 february near bucaramanga, in the northeastern part of the country, along with his secretary jorge mesa, who was released on monday.    the eln released mesa with a message for former social conservative president misael pastrana (1970-1974), reiterating that sedano will be released only if he declares that he is opposed to the dirty war and reveals the whereabouts of fernando porras, an eln member who disappeared in bucaramanga on 5 february.  according to the guerrillas, porras was arrested and \"disappeared\" by the 5th army brigade, which denies this.    the eln is the only colombian guerrilla group that has persisted in the armed struggle.  the five other rebel groups have declared unilateral truces to guarantee a climate of peace for the upcoming elections.    these groups are the communist revolutionary armed forces of colombia, the maoist popular liberation army, the trotskyist (revolutionary) workers party, and the indian \"quintin lame\" movement, in addition to the 19 april movement, which is about to conclude a peace process begun 16 months ago.\n",

      "  the nicaraguan contras charged in tegucigalpa today that on 19 february the sandinist air force used airplanes and helicopters to bomb several communities in zelaya, matagalpa, and jinotega departments, in central and northern nicaragua.    the rebels did not report any dead or wounded in the alleged attacks, which the contras say are part of an offensive begun in the days prior to the elections, scheduled for sunday, 25 february.    in a communique, the contras indicated that their fighters are not attacking sandinist military targets, and that the purpose of the nicaraguan military action was to \"create confusion\" regarding the electoral process.    on the other hand, commander \"franklin\" of the nicaraguan resistance (rn) general staff said that the rn will remain \"intact,\" even in the event that the elections are won by violeta de chamorro, candidate of the national opposition union (uno).    \"we will remain intact to see if there is a total transmission of power on 25 april, in which the new government will make in-depth reforms, particularly the elimination of the repressive system,\" he added.    the rn military chief said that if the sandinists win or \"steal\" the elections, there will be a \"social uprising\" in nicaragua against the system, and there will be \"a harsher struggle than that of past years.\"    \"franklin\" said that the sandinists have deployed some 30,000 troops to departments in northern nicaragua to \"intimidate and murder\" uno sympathizers.  he emphasized that the contras will not put down their weapons, because the cause that led to the creation of those forces -- the sandinists' ascent to power -- \"has not yet disappeared,\" and \"the repression continues.\"    he added that his fighters are willing to leave the camps in eastern honduras if the honduran government requests that they do so, but their families would remain.\n",

      "  colombian government minister carlos lemos has hinted that it may have been members of the marxist guerrilla group army of national liberation (eln) who have murdered the 77 followers of the left-wing party the patriotic union (up).    lemos said: i can expect anything from the eln.  he added that he believed that this group makes no exceptions when it wants to kill someone.    the up has blamed president virgilio barco's government and the military for the annihilation campaign against its members, demanding guarantees for their political activities with less than two weeks before the 11 march legislative elections take place.    the up made the report following the murder on 26 february of apartado mayor diana cordoba saldarriaga -- apartado is located 480 km to the northeast of bogota -- and the murder on the evening of 27 february of six more up followers in unguia, a village in choco department.  when blaming the eln, the government minister said that these individuals want to bring anarchy and instability to the country.  lemos added that as part of the eln's destablization campaign, it would not be difficult to imagine that they would have the murder people of other left-wing sectors as their goal, and admitted that there has been a series of threats against various government officials, including himself.  when referring to the up's reports holding the military responsible, he said that this was absurd and added that it is intended to lead the investigations astray and to try to stop the elections in colombia.\n",

      "  military sources reported today that fighting broke out on the night of 5 march in the war-torn chalatenango department to the north of san salvador, where the guerrillas suffered eight casualties.    the armed forces press committee reported that the clashes took place near san isidro labrador, where three guerrillas were killed and five others were wounded.    the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln), which has been fighting the u.s.-backed army for the last 10 years, has traditionally maintained a high profile in strategic areas of chalatenango.    meanwhile, urban guerrilla commandos harassed troops belonging to the 1st infantry brigade last night at the mariona penitentiary, located on the northern outskirts of san salvador, apparently leaving no casualties.    atlacatl battalion troops, which maintain a counterinsurgency operation at the foothills of guazapa hill, to the north of san salvador, confiscated war materiel that the guerrillas had hidden underground.    in another turn of events, fmln sappers who continuously sabotage the electrical power system destroyed several high-voltage posts in la libertad and cabanas departments in the central part of the country, and in usulutan department in the southeastern part of the country.    there were widespread power outages in the three departments while technicians of the state-run electric power companies repaired the damage.    the army and security corps deployed heavy patrols in san salvador and in cities in the country's interior to try and counter the wave of attacks.\n",

      "  good evening, listeners.  in order to bring calm to all san salvador residents, and also to people living in the interior of the country, we inform you that a few minutes ago, experts of the electric light company of el salvador, caes, confirmed that despite a few attacks on some power towers, energy service is completely normal throughout san salvador.  the caes experts added that there was a short power outage in large parts of san salvador, but that the situation is back to normal now.  the experts said that they also detected some damage in the energy system.    as you may have heard on this radio station earlier, harassment operations were carried out in several parts of san salvador at approximately 2115 tonight.    farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) leftist guerrillas attacked military positions in san ramon, ayutuxtepeque, mejicanos, and cuscatancingo tonight.  it was said that a number of fmln members conducted lightning attacks on those military positions and then withdrew from the area immediately.    it was reported that the attack in san ramon lasted approximately 15 minutes, after which the army took control of that entire area. reports state that after the attack in ayutuxtepeque the guerrillas moved toward el carmen hill and counterinsurgency battalion members were pursuing the rebel columns there.  it was also reported that the rebels attacked military positions in cuscatancingo and on el fito street, mejicanos jurisdiction.    a few minutes ago it was reported that the shooting ended in ayutuxtepeque and in the other parts of northern san salvador, and that an air force helicopter is overflying the area to counteract the rebels' movement.    it was also confirmed that energy has been restored in some parts of san salvador, but not in cuscatancingo and ciudad delgado, where the guerrillas blew up several power towers.    the armed forces press committee (coprefa) has only stated that no casualties are reported as a result of these harassment operations, especially in the area of ayutuxtepeque.  coprefa indicated that 1st infantry brigade members have already taken strategic positions throughout northern san salvador and that these men are supported by salvadoran air force helicopters, which are lighting the area with spotlights and flares.    according to the official report, the situation at this time is completely normal in northern san salvador, despite the panic that spread at approximately 2115 when heavy shooting, machinegun fire, and the detonation of powerful bombs were heard.    neither coprefa nor the specific military positions that were attacked have reported casualties so far.  it was said that tomorrow morning coprefa will issue an overall report on the results of these clashes.  salvadoran red cross sources said tonight that they do not know of any civilian casualty resulting from these armed incidents.    this has been a report on the attacks carried out in northern san salvador tonight.  we invite you to join us tomorrow for a report on the development of events.\n",

      "  the general command of the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) deems as positive the government's recognition of the fmln's good-will gestures.  however, we view as a negative that in the government's response there is not a corresponding attitude. in this regard, we inform:    1.  the government response tries to undermine our gesture.  the fmln has never had a policy to attack or harm the civilian population. our gestures are a clear contribution to strengthening the space of other political and social forces to allow for their participation in the political negotiation solution process and in the effort to humanize the conflict.    2.  the government and the armed forces continue to violate human rights, bomb civilian populated areas, subject the country to a permanent state of siege, be it legal or de facto.  in a constant and systematic manner, the government maintains a policy of capturing and torturing leaders of people's groups; maintains sieges and raids; harasses the communities of repatriates; and sabotages the property of residents in areas under the fmln control.    in the meantime, no step has been taken to investigate and punish the murder of monsignor romero and the massacre of fenastras (salvadoran workers national union federation), while the trial against the murderers of the jesuit priests has stagnated and the suspects are promoted or sent abroad.    the government intends to appoint as defense minister the person who gave the order to murder the priests, and it allows the reported executioner to live in a luxury apartment.    3.  we agree with the permanent, serious, important, and reserved character that the negotiation process should have.    4.  the government is morally and politically compelled to implement as soon as possible goodwill gestures that will permit the exercise of citizen's freedoms and cease the daily human rights violations and all forms of aggression aimed at the civilian population.    5.  we warn that it would be regrettable for the people's peace and democracy hopes that the government and the armed forces try to harden warmongering positions, believing in the mirage of an alleged weakness of the fmln.  obviously, this mistake would only lead to a worsening of the war and would further delay the possibilities of negotiations, democratization, and peace for el salvador.    fmln general command    (signed) commander shafik jorge handal, commander eduardo sancho, commander salvador sanchez ceren, commander francisco jovel, commander joaquin villalobos    (issued in) el salvador, 15 march 1990\n",

      "  the salvadoran armed forces charged today that a group of guerrillas attacked a contingent of soldiers in the town of victoria, northeastern cabanas department, from a settlement for displaced persons.  there were no casualties.    the armed forces press committee (coprefa) has stated that the rebels fired m-60 machineguns at a patrol of soldiers passing by the santa marta settlement, where some 3,000 displaced persons live.    the military report said that the incident took place on 15 march and the soldiers did not answer the fire.    however, the christian committee for displaced salvadorans (cripdes) denied that there are any armed persons in this settlement, where the persons who recently came back from the honduran camp of mesa grande are living.    tomasa ruiz, spokesperson for cripdes, said that the charges \"are a direct threat\" to the security of the displaced persons in santa marta.  \"this does not mean,\" she added, \"that there are no confrontations taking place outside the camp, but there are no armed persons inside the camp.\"    the armed forces have said that the guerrillas are hiding among the civilian population in order to attack the soldiers.    on 11 february, one adult and four minors were killed and 16 others were wounded when a salvadoran air force helicopter strafed a camp of displaced persons in corral de piedras, chalatenango department.  on that occasion the army said that the guerrillas attacked the government troops from the settlement of refugees who returned to the country late last year, after having lived nearly one decade in the honduran camps.    in addition, the armed forces said that three soldiers had been wounded during fighting with the guerrillas in the town of san jose guayabal, in the central cuscatlan department.    these charges were made public on 16 march when the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) announced a suspension of sabotage actions on public transportation, business establishments, and the telecommunications center, as well as attacks on civilian officials.    the army also maintained that the rebels blew up five electricity posts in san vicente and morazan department in the center and northeastern parts of the country.  the rebels also harassed soldiers who were guarding an electricity station in a town of santa ana department and a military checkpoint on the bridge over the acelhuate river in aguilares, north of san salvador.    according to the military report, these harassment actions by the rebels did not cause any casualties.\n",

      "  tension prevailed this evening in the capital after the body of patriotic union (up) candidate bernardo jaramillo ossa was transferred to the oval room in the national congress, where he will lie in state until his funeral on 24 march.    bogota mayor andres pastrana arango decreed a dry law at noon, and suspended classes in private and public elementary and high schools tomorrow, 23 march.    the president attended a security council meeting at natino palace and the military commanders talked with journalists when leaving the premises.  defense minister oscar botero said that the medellin cartel planned and carried out the assassination upon instructions from pablo escobar gaviria, who made a down payment of 300,000 pesos to andres arturo gutierrez, the assassin hired to perpetrate the crime.    the assassin, a 16-year-old youth, is recovering from his wounds and, in a preliminary declaration to the authorities, he confirmed who ordered the assassination.    moreover, das (administrative department of security) detective edison sanchez mendieta, who was wounded this morning at the airport terminal, was released this afternoon.    referring to the way in which the weapon was smuggled into the airport, the authorities said that this issue is being thoroughly investigated by security organizations -- because it could have been assembled inside the premises or smuggled in with the complicity of a maintenance worker.    riots, clashes, and the burning of tires and five buses was reported in several higher education centers of bogota, such as the free university, the pedagogical university, the national university; and in neighborhoods such as policarpa salavarrieta, garces navas, and soacha.  these actions resulted in the wounding of a policeman, whose condition is still critical.    teachers who are members of fecode (colombian federation of educators) have ordered a two-day strike starting tomorrow.  banana farm workers in uraba, where the assassinated leader worked as a labor lawyer, reacted similarly.    transportation activities have noticeably decreased in the capital since the mayor urged the citizenry to go home early in the evening.    the assassinated candidate's body is currently lying in state in the oval room of the national congress.\n",

      "  the maoist shining path terrorist organization and the tupac amaru revolutionary movement (mrta) are staging attacks in an attempt to make the people boycott the 8 april peruvian elections.    a bomb exploded early this morning near the house of health minister paul caro gamarra.  caro's wife said that the house, which is in the port of el callao, lacks police protection.    the headquarters of the center-rightist democratic front (fredemo), whose presidential candidate is the writer mario vargas llosa, was bombed last night.  the mrta claimed the attack through leaflets left at the scene.    the mrta also planted explosives and left leaflets beside five fredemo placards.    forty members of fredemo were at the headquarters, which is on an important lima avenue, when the attack occurred.  nobody was injured. david cifuentes, a deputy candidate of the ruling american popular revolutionary alliance (apra) today said that there is a terrorist plot to kill the presidential candidates.    on 14 march cifuentes escaped unharmed from an attack on the car in which he was travelling.  his bodyguard died in the attack which occurred 40 km from the city of cajamarca.    the terrorists placed big stones at a curve in the road which caused the vehicle to run off the road.  the attackers then opened fire on the car.    cifuentes fell out of the vehicle and broke his arm in two places, and is now in hospital.    shining path members recently murdered 19 people, including 10 children, in a small village near huancayo city, 415 km south of lima. this act clearly shows that the maoists are determined to continue killing and destroying.    some 300 people were murdered by the shining path during the boycott of the municipal elections on 12 november 1989.    the attacks perpetrated by the mrta last night belies the alleged announcement that they will cease to use violence.  this announcement was published by a local newspaper two days ago.    united left deputy gustavo espinosa, in a statement to the daily onda, said that if the mrta is truly seeking a political way to turn in their weapons \"they would contribute to the pacification of the country.\"    however, espinosa said that one cannot consider an end to the violence until there is more proof of their announcement.    during the past 10 years, the shining path and the mrta have perpetrated more than 16,000 attacks which have caused damage estimated at $10,000.  this estimate was prepared by the congressional commission in charge of assessing the effects and causes of political violence in peru.    during president alan garcia's term of office the terrorists have perpetrated 10,621 attacks, which represents an average of more than six attacks per day during his five years in power.    fatal victims of political violence amount to approximately 19,000, of which 700 have died during 1990.\n",

      "  the attacks on five offices of the democratic front (fredemo), which is headed by mario vargas llosa, on the office of the ruling american popular revolutionary alliance, apra, and against one telephone exchange, two banks, one store, and one movie theater, show that terrorism in peru continues to be used in an attempt to boycott the 8 april elections.    one girl was wounded during the explosions that occurred in lima yesterday, and four individuals were arrested while looting two shoe stores and a market and urging people to join them.    the attacks seriously damaged the offices of the political parties, especially that of the fredemo, but no one was injured.    the pagina libre newspaper today reported that seven alleged members of the movement of the revolutionary left (mir) were arrested in the city of trujillo, 570 km north of lima.  the mir is a faction of the pro-guevara tupac amaru revolutionary movement (mrta).    the maoist shining path terrorist organization has called for \"an armed strike\" -- a strike under threat of death -- in lima tomorrow. this is the third armed strike to be called by this organization so far this month.    a 48-hour armed strike was called in ayacucho, the birthplace of the shining path organization and the other one in huanta.    president alan garcia yesterday delivered 170 patrol cars to the national police.  he urged the police to resolutely face the increasing wave of terrorism and to make use of all available resources.    the national police yesterday commissioned a squad of 16 motorcycles to patrol the city and to go directly to the sites of attacks.    it is expected that subversives will increase the number of attacks in a wave of terror before the elections and this is why the police and military forces have been put on alert.    about 100,000 policemen have been put on alert throughout the country following the murder last week of four candidates for deputies, an apra leader, and the managers of several businesses in lima, and other cities.    lima and callao have been placed in a state of emergency, which means that individual guarantees have been suspended.    yesterday ayacucho was left in darkness after a shining path attack.  at least three people were killed, several were wounded, and various arrests were made by the police.    yesterday was the most violent day in ayacucho since last november when municipal elections were held.  the elections were then annulled because of the high number of null and blank votes.    last week in huancayo, 415 km southeast of lima, an apra candidate for deputy was murdered.  yesterday an individual was wounded when a car bomb exploded causing extensive material damage.    yesterday in chiclayo, in northern peru, a bomb was thrown at the house of fredemo candidate for deputy miguel angel bartra, who was not in the house at the time.    in la libertad department a terrorist group took over the guadalupito town early yesterday morning in an effort to find the local apra secretary general and the town's mayor.    when the terrorists could not find them, they blew up the offices of the municipality and the power station causing an outage in the zone.    the strikes affecting 100,000 workers in the country continue and the strikers have rejected the \"labor truce\" until the elections are over that had been requested by interior minister agustin mantilla.    mantilla said that the strikes \"are bordering on the seditious and the criminal.\"    in the last 10 years political violence in peru has caused 19,000 deaths, of which 700 have occurred so far this year.\n",

      "  five soldiers were killed and five were wounded during a fierce guerrilla attack this morning in the city of suchitoto, cuzcatlan department, in the central part of the country, military spokespersons have reported.    the sources indicated that the rebel attack by rifle fire began at 0120 today and lasted for four hours.  after this, the army was in control of the situation.  the number of rebel casualties is not known.    the fighting began when farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) guerrillas attacked the las guaras bridge guard post in the city of suchitoto, 44 km from san salvador.    the military sources said that early this morning the army was in control of the situation.  however, artillery units are conducting a combing operation in an effort to capture the rebels.    guerrillas activities have increased over the past few days after the fmln signed an agreement with the government last wednesday in geneva (switzerland) to continue the dialogue to resolve the 10-year conflict in the country.    fmln guerrillas attacked armed forces positions in the northern and southern parts of the capital for more than a half hour yesterday, resulting in two rebels being killed and one wounded, according to military reports.    the fmln has also intensified its sabotage of electricity pylons, above all in the capital.  this week the fmln rebels brought down at least 20 electricity pylons, causing power outages in different parts of the country.\n",

      "  the criminal drug mafias operating in colombia announced today that they will increase their terrorist attacks on \"the industrial and political oligarchy\" in response to the alleged disappearance of several of their accomplices.    in a communique sent by telefax to several news media, \"the extraditables,\" spokesmen for the mafias, said that their \"war\" will be carried out henceforth because of the \"disappearance, torture, and assassination\" of several drug traffickers at the hands of the directorate of judicial police and investigations (dijin).    according to the criminals, who again described themselves as a \"political-military\" organization, \"the problem of the extradition has been relegated to a secondary status, since our main motive for the war will be the torture, assassination, and disappearance of our comrades.\"    a few days ago, in a similar message, the criminals said that they would place 5-ton dynamite bombs in \"neighborhoods of the bogota oligarchy,\" in reprisal for offensive actions by the authorities.    yesterday, a car-bomb with 800 kg of dynamite was left by drug traffickers in an exclusive sector of the capital.  had it not been for a defect in the detonator, it would have killed at least 5,000 (number as received) people.    according to the criminals, the resurgence of terrorist attacks is due to the \"disappearance\" late last month of jose retavista garzon, freddy lopez ospina, and brothers omar and guillermo perea rivera, who reportedly were arrested by the police in the northwestern town of envigado.    however, according to an investigation carried out yesterday by the attorney general's office, these persons are not confined in any garrison of the elite force, a police antiterrorist corps.    \"the extraditables\" noted that \"the good faith of the attorney general's office in no way satisfies our demands, because the missing companions were taken out of the school (police headquarters) and executed by order of dijin director oscar pelaez carmona, whom they accuse of \"masterminding\" several massacres.    the drug trafficking mafia also said that the killings of policemen had been suspended (14 uniformed policemen have been killed in medellin since last monday) and that they had never participated in \"torture,\" but, they added, \"we will intensify our struggle against the industrial and political oligarchy, which is an accomplice to the assassinations.\"    the war against the drug mafias in colombia, which appears to have experienced a violent resurgence, began last august after mercenaries at the service of the criminal groups assassinated in the space of a few hours a magistrate, a police colonel, and presidential hopeful luis carlos galan.\n",

      "  the \"shining path\" terrorist organization is keeping three peruvian cities under pressure with three \"armed strikes\"-- strikes enforced by death threats--that began today in an effort to force a boycott of tomorrow's general elections.    ayacucho, the capital of the southern department of ayacucho, is under a state of military emergency.  there is neither electricity nor water in the city, and every activity has been suspended as a result of the three-day \"armed strike\" called as of today.  there is no transportation either, stores are closed, and the streeets are patrolled by the army and the military police.  roads linking ayacucho with the departmental provinces of cangallado and la mar were blocked by shining path terrorists with stones and tree trunks.  the 55-km road linking ayacucho with the city of huanta is guarded by 4,000 members of the \"peasant patrols,\" which are opposed to the \"shining path.\"  there are a few vans on the road, under military surveillance. \"shining path\" terrorists have destroyed a suspension bridge linking ayacucho with the province of julcamarca, which was thus forced into isolation.    candidates for deputy from ayacucho department for the ruling apra (american popular revolutionary alliance), the vargas llosa-led democratic front (fredemo), and the united left, as well as foreign and local journalists who will covering the election in that area are all lodged in a hotel in ayacucho.  \"shining path\" has threatened to blow up the hotel, which is heavily guarded by the police.    meanwhile, the people of ayacucho are checking the voter lists to find out where each voter will have to cast his vote tomorrow.    the shining path also called for an \"armed strike\" from today until monday in huaraz, capital of the ancash department, bordering lima department to the north.  the city was paralyzed and in the dark following the destruction of a high-tension pylon six km from the city.  as the result of that attack, five provinces of ancash were left without electricity.    the shining path terrorists hurled explosives at a market in huaraz, injuring 15 people.  the huaraz-lima road was blocked for 15 hours when shining path guerrillas set two trucks loaded with minerals on fire.  ancash department lies outside the area under the state of emergency that encompasses half of peru, including the metropolitan lima area.    huancayo, 415 km southeast of lima, is completely paralyzed by the \"armed strike\" imposed by the shining path. all activities-- banks, commerce, markets, public transportation--have been suspended. since friday there have been eight bombings of public and private facilities.  a car was destroyed by a bomb.  the city's electricity supply has been cut, following the destruction of three high-tension pylons.  also affected was the electricity supply in the entire mantaro river valley, where the country's largest hydroelectric plant is located. this plant supplies 80 percent of peru's electricity.    since last year, shining path terrorists have been extending their activities from the department of ayacucho to the strategic department of junin, bordering the department of lima. junin provides most of lima's food.\n",

      "  the government has announced a total offensive to capture medellin cartel boss pablo escobar gaviria following the death yesterday of nine people in an attack by the extraditables in medellin.    the offensive was announced at the end of an urgent meeting of the security council called by government minister horacio serpa uribe, who is acting president because of president virgilio barco's trip to nicaragua to attend the inauguration of president violeta chamorro.    serpa said that escobar has become enemy no. one and noted that all of the authorities' efforts are now centered on his capture. the minister said that escobar is behind the violence onslaught and asked the population to cooperate with the authorities' efforts to capture him. \"pablo escobar is behind the violence onslaught,\" the government minister said.    nine people died and approximately 50 were wounded when a car loaded with 200 kg of dynamite exploded in a heavily populated district in medellin known as las americas. police sources said that the car bomb, which was camouflaged with construction waste, was set off by remote control at a passing elite police patrol.    the explosion seriously damaged over 10 private vehicles and at least three buses with passengers as well as a dozen business establishments and private residences.    defense minister general oscar botero restrepo said that the attack was the work of the extraditables, the armed wing of the medellin cartel, one of the biggest drug processing and drug trafficking organizations in the world. medellin, colombia's second largest city, is the home of the cartel and of its armed wing--the extraditables--which described themselves in march as a political-military organization and declared war on the colombian state.    the extraditables announced at the time that they were relegating their struggle to prevent the extradition of colombians to the united states to second place and that their top priority would be to fight the state, the oligarchy and the members of the police who kidnap, torture and murder the members of their organization and their families.    yesterday's attack was the second to be carried out against colombia's special antidrug and counterinsurgency elite police corps. on 11 march another car bomb loaded with over 100 kg of dynamite was exploded against a police vehicle on the freeway south of medellin. eight policemen and nine civilians were killed in the explosion.\n",

      "  colombians, during these months of national tragedy we have been hit by events over and over again.  violence strikes the hearts of our institutions, values, democracy, and our best men.  the ultimate goal of those engaged in violence is to prevent democracy from functioning. that is why they have unleashed their evil against options for changes that could strengthen democracy and prevent violence in colombia. brave colombians have been murdered, one by one.  their existence was a threat to the survival of violent practices.  it is not a coincidence that during the current electoral campaign three presidential candidates have been murdered.  it is not a coincidence either that other brave minds that advocated reform had been killed before in that struggle.    rodrigo lara, who was murdered six years on 23 april, was the first to denounce the grave effects of drug trafficking on the stability of our institutions.  those who killed him wanted to open paths for the so-called crime tolerance.    guillermo cano, a brave newsman, represented a free, critical press, such as is needed in a true democracy.  his killers thought that by drowning out his voice they would intimidate the defenders of freedom of speech.    luis carlos galan was killed eight months ago.  by killing him, they sought to assassinate a hope of renovation and change and a deep conviction for the need to radically transform political habits and the climate of corruption, immorality, and indifference in the face of crime.  this indifference led to the emergence of the great evils that are causing bloodshed in the country.    bernardo jaramillo struggled for a peaceful, democratic left that rejected armed struggle and that wanted to build a more just society. by killing him, the criminals sought to block the paths to legitimate protest within the law.    carlos pizarro, the last link in this macabre chain that includes so many others, represented the possibility for guerrilla groups to lay down their weapons and join institutional politics, or for weapons to be replaced by legal instruments to struggle for legitimate ideals. by killing him in a dastardly and cowardly manner yesterday, they sought to destroy the process of reconciliation and reincorporation of armed groups into civil life.    the death of our countrymen should not be in vain.  it strikes deep in our hearts.  it affects the spirit profoundly.  it must, therefore, awaken the national conscience, because those crimes are not merely vile crimes against unarmed great men who believed in the strength of ideals.  these have been crimes against our basic values, against the clean ideals of progress and peace that these men represented.  we must not be mistaken.  those who killed our leaders did not extinguish the noble cause for which they gave their lives.  their values will prevail.  they are our values.  their hopes still live.  those hopes belong to all colombians.  their dream will never disappear.  it is the dream we all have of attaining peace and prosperity.  that is why i praise what antonio navarro said last night: \"i invite the m-19 (19 april movement) to continue walking along the path that pizarro charted.  terrorism's goal has been to close the paths to change, renovation, and reform.    our path, on the contrary, is to make peaceful, democratic revolution viable.  it is a revolution of hope.  this deep crisis will not be solved by restrictions and limitations imposed on the instruments of democracy, but by uniting efforts of all good colombians to repair the roads to change, renovation, and reform.

      "  communique issued by the general command of the fmln: we announce that between the night of 1 may and the early morning of 2 may, our forces conducted several military operations in san salvador and other cities of the country in response to:    1. the prevailing total impunity of members of the armed forces in violating human rights, as demonstrated by the standstill reached in the trial, the evident cover up of the masterminds of the assassination of the jesuit priests, the release of the group of kidnappers, and the recent murder of a university professor and a cooperative leader.    2.  the military offensive launched by the armed forces in rural areas with indiscriminate bombings and arrests of civilians.    3.  the arrogant and boastful attitude of the government and the military because of an alleged weakness shown by the fmln, which obstructs the negotiation process.    4.  the unpopular economic measures and the plans to carry out the biggest economic fraud and act of corruption in our country's history with the privatization of banks.    we believe that:    1.  the u.s. congressional plan to cut only 50 percent of the military assistance to the government is not enough.  any assistance to terrorist armed forces only contributes to war and reduces the possibility for a short-term cease-fire agreement.    2.  as long as there are no guarantees for the entire society, as long as crimes committed by the military go unpunished, and as long as repression does not stop, war will continue.    finally we reiterate our willingness to continue the negotiation process.  consequently, we have already presented our positions to the government and are awaiting its reply so that we can start holding the negotiations.

      "  san salvador domestic service in spanish at 1808 gmt on 3 may begins to broadcast live a news conference with salvadoran president alfredo cristiani from the presidential house in san salvador.    cristiani begins by saying that the government is looking to put together a viable agenda for its upcoming meeting with the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) so that some headway can be made in the talks.  he adds: \"from what we can foresee, we hope the direct meetings will begin in a week and a half, or somewhere around there.  that is when we think they could start....  in general terms, we do believe progress will be made and that we will advance quite rapidly.\"    in response to a question regarding a letter from an unnamed group of young military officers advocating a purge of the military and supporting criticisms made by former army colonel sigifredo ochoa perez, cristiani says: \"i have never believed anonymous letters or notes.  the fact that it is anonymous casts some doubt on the intentions behind it or about the group that could be sending it. posing as young officers is easy to do.  this could have come from the fmln -- making an issue of all that they have been talking about -- or from any other group.\"    regarding the fmln communique on the rebels' recent military offensive, he states: \"i read the communique and i honestly believe that it is one of the most ridiculous fmln communiques i have seen to date....  i feel that this was a way to seek notoriety through the news.  this could be one of the reasons.  the other reason could be that they are having problems among themselves....  some of them view the dialogue as something serious while others do not, and it could be that these problems are resulting in these irrational adventures by the fmln.\"    turning to recent u.s. government criticism charging slowness in the handling of the investigation and prosecution of those involved in the jesuit murder case, cristiani says: \"as chief executive, i cannot speed up, slow down, or alter the judge's decisions.  in no democracy can the chief executive dictate orders to the judicial branch.  the same happens in the united states as in any other democratic country. i believe that as far as we have been able to see -- although there is much urgency in seeing this trial completed; there are great expectations -- that the judge is duty bound to continue with the judicial procedures stipulated by salvadoran law.\"  he points out that the prosecution of general noriega in the united states is also taking a long time.    regarding a reported fmln attack on his residence in san salvador yesterday, cristiani says: \"i do not know who the person was who reported an attack on the presidential residence, either the official or the private one.  neither of them was attacked, though there could have been some information that such an attack was expected.  an fmln column was dispersed in areas close to the two residences.\"    questioned about the effects on the government of a possible cut in u.s. government aid to el salvador, cristiani responds:  \"well, i think that first of all, the effects of a reduction or cut of aid would be twofold. first, i think it would be a negative signal for the fmln and for the objective of trying to find an end to the conflict through the dialogue process that has been started; and that a cut in aid might be analyzed by some of the members, or all the members of the fmln, as meaning a weakening of the government and its defense and that, therefore, their military victory is now closer.  and it would make it a lot more difficult to end the conflict in a short while through a political dialogue.  second, obviously the government has the responsibility to defend the institutions, the democratic institutions of the country, and will not standby with a weakened defense.  therefore, this means reallocating resources that might be used for other types of programs -- social programs, economic or political programs -- ...  for defense purposes.\"    returning the jesuits murder case, cristiani is asked if the military high command is being investigated.  he says:  \"first of all i would say that the high command -- and this is just my own point of view -- was instrumental in making it possible to carry out the investigation.  the high command made it possible for the investigation to be within the armed forces, an investigation that has no precedent in the past with respect to investigating military units....  it would be very difficult to believe that by supporting the investigation and opening up the armed forces so that they can be investigated in this case, they would have done so if there were some involvement on their part.\"    further as available.\n",

      "  the police confirmed today that presidential candidate alberto fujimori escaped a dynamite attack perpetrated by a shining path cell on 6 may.  according to the police, the dynamite charge was detonated on the route followed by fujimori's motorcade in the district capital of san juan de lurigancho.    the attackers left fliers identifying themselves as members of the movement for the people's defense, a shining path front organization. dora vilchez, a 26-year-old woman, was injured in the attack.    fujimori, who will contend with writer mario vargas llosa in a runoff election during the first half of june, was only informed of the attack by his aides after the police had tightened their security around him.  the \"change 90\" leader minimized the attack and continued his scheduled activities.    the police said that a shining path group managed to infiltrate a crowd of demonstrators and set off the dynamite charge on the route followed by fujimori's motorcade, near a local market, on the eastern side of lima.    vilchez, who was seriously injured, was hospitalized.    the bomb squad unit (ude) defused another explosive device near the market.    the fliers disseminated by the terrorists urged the people not to vote in the runoff election.  one of the fliers said: \"neither fujimori nor vargas llosa is the solution because they both represent the right wing.  long live the armed struggle.  pcp.sl.\"  expansion unknown\n",

      "  the peruvian police, and parts of the army, have received orders of \"strict confinement to barracks\" in view of the 17 may anniversary of the terrorist organization shining path.  the organization has announced it will celebrate its 10th anniversary with an increase in armed operations.    peruvian authorities have discovered that the group that rebelled on 17 may 1980 has devised \"a celebrations plan\" and that it intends to implement the plan as \"a sign of victory\" in the \"struggle of movements,\" an ideology inspired in mao zedong's doctrine.    army personnel have been confined to barracks since the night of 12 may and have already participated on joint operations with the police to arrest 500 alleged terrorists.    in lima, 8,000 police agents and a special antiexplosives squad launched \"a gigantic operation\" of \"blockades and saturation.\"    a police spokesman told efe that they had orders \"to carefully comb the new urban areas and search for suspected criminals, arms, explosives, or subversive material.\"    according to the spokesman, the lima police department headed by general osvaldo diaz has orders \"to watch roads entering the city, to install emergency check points in strategic locations, and to report on anything unusual.\"    according to official sources, the operation will continue until after the runoff election, which is expected to be held on 10 june.    the police have launched similar operations in regions where guerrilla activity is rampant such as ayacucho, puno, huancayo, and huancavelica in the peruvian central highlands.  these regions are all under states of emergency and under military control.    shining path, considered one of the most impenetrable and orthodox armed movements in latin america, began celebrating its anniversary in lima last week by burning 11 state transport company buses. the buses were attacked by hooded individuals thought to be shining path militants.    on 11 may a bomb destroyed a building owned by the family of the mayor of lima.  in another incident in lima today, police corporal oswaldo palomino, who served in ayacucho until a short time ago, was shot to death.    in ayacucho, where the the comunist party of peru -- \"official\" name of shining path -- was born and developed, two people were murdered, and various home-made bombs exploded in in the last 24 hours.    councilmen juan manuel garabito from piura, 1,100 km north of lima, has also been shot to death. authorities blamed shining path for these attacks.    observers of the peruvian guerrilla movement told efe that the growing tide of violence attibuted to shining path indicates that the radical, or \"red\" sector, of the rebel group has taken control of the organization.    according to the sources, two different factions within the organization clashed over the celebration of the group's anniversary: the younger and radical sectors favored purely military operations while the older sector, or \"blacks,\" favored more political and historic activities.    shining path, which officially operates with approximately 5,000 armed men, has caused the death of 20,000 people, including 7,000 civilians, and it is responsible for $17 billion in direct damages to the country over its 10 year history.\n",

      "  terrorist actions were reported tonight south of guatemala city, a few hours after a mass transit bus and several tires were burned in other parts of the city. two explosions took place in a vacant lot at approximately 2120 on 15th avenue and 6th street, zone 13.  according to persons who were nearby at that time, shooting was heard before the explosions. a few minutes later, devices, believed to be fragmentation grenades, went off.  the shock wave created by the blast shattered the windows of house number 729 and building 626, located in front of the vacant lot.  the explosion prompted the quick mobilization of firemen, policemen, and several army armored personnel carriers from la aurora military base.    several members of the special orange explosive squad (unidad naranja especial de lucha antiexplosivos) also arrived to defuse another device left in the area.  at first, it was reported that the home close to the site of the explosion belongedto newsman alvaro contreras velez.  we were not able to verify this report.  we just learned that a family by the name of diaz navarro lives there.  there were no fatalities, but damage to the buildings are reported.    newsman contreras velez, prensa libre editor and author of the \"cacto\" column, came to the area to observe the damage.  it was unofficially established that some government officials live in this sector. municipal firemen helped police authorities in combing the area after the explosions.    the rumor that a car bomb exploded on 7th avenue and 7th street, zone 9, circulated almost simultaneously.  later, it was learned that the explosion was caused by a booby trap.  the authorities are on alert and stepped up operations, a police spokesman said.    again at 2230 tonight, national police explosive experts discovered another device in the vacant lot where two other bombs had gone off earlier.  ten homes were damaged by one of the explosions, including the homes of deputy finances minister gustavo adolfo leiva and guatemala governor mario logorgon.  only material damage was caused. the area residents have been evacuated from the site.  another charge went off in front of the air force's main gate almost at the same time the first bomb went off.  air force officials closed hincapie avenue, from liberacion boulevard to santa fe.  the officers reported material damage and and an exchange of fire in the area nearby.  firemen and policemen and several army armored personnel carriers patrolling the city are maintaning security.\n",

      "  colombian judge bernardo jaramillo uribe was assassinated at noon today in medellin, located 500 km northwest of bogota, it was reported today by the national police.    this is the fourth judge riddled with bullets by unidentified gunmen -- apparently paid assassins at the service of the drug trafficking mafias -- in medellin within 5 months. judge maria helena diaz was assassinated on 28 july; medellin higher court magistrate hector jimenez was killed on 17 october; and magistrate mariela espinoza was killed on 1 november.    jaramillo uribe worked as judge of the 13th criminal court in medellin, the headquarters of the medellin drug cartel.    a police report indicates that jaramillo uribe was shot at from two automobiles in the western sector of antioquia province's capital, when he was leaving his office.    the crimes have led to protests and strikes by colombian judges and judicial branch officials, who have demanded better protection from president virgilio barco's liberal party government.    judge jaramillo uribe was investigating the massacre of 43 persons in the town of segovia (located in the west) by a paramilitary group; and the murder of colonel waldemar franklin quintero, commander of the antioquia police.\n",

      "  just a few minutes ago two very strong explosions occurred in the center of bogota.  we felt these explosions here at the rcn (radio cadena nacional) building. one of the explosions occurred in the vicinity of the courts in the palo quemado sector, where all the bogota judicial branch offices are located. apparently the other explosion occurred in a street near the presidential palace.    there were two explosions occurring consecutively but very close together, which is why it was felt so strongly.  it initially felt like an earthquake: first the wave and then the explosion.  all the residents in this central area of bogota felt it.    it is also said that the explosion could have occurred closer to the administrative department of security, das, which is located in the same area.  the das headquarters are just around the corner from the judicial branch offices in palo quemado.  the strong explosion that was felt by all of us who work at this hour in the central bogota area took place at 19th carrera and 25th street in palo quemado.  i repeat, two consecutive explosions occurred at 0735 in the center of bogota.    here is some updated information: it was not two explosions, as we had intially believed, but three explosions that occurred a few minutes ago in bogota. one of them was in the palo quemado sector, as we have already reported, in the area where both the bogota courts and das are located.  another explosion occurred in the southern part of bogota at 14th carrera and 28th street south, apparently near an agrarian trust branch in the barrio gustavo restrepo neighborhood.  a third explosion occurred in the central area of bogota.  these three explosions in bogota took place almost simultaneously, just a few seconds apart.    we now have official figures of the explosion near the das headquarters: seven persons were killed, more than 50 were wounded, and approximately 25 vehicles and at least 15 buildings -- including the das offices that were partially destroyed -- were damaged. initially, das officials have estimated that a powerful bomb of more than 100 kg of dynamite placed in a truck was activated.    the huge explosion caused the initial destruction of the front part of the das headquarters, as well as a building where there was a hardware store, and the total destruction of six or seven other buildings.  a crater 15 meters wide and 6 meters deep was created in 27th carrera.    most of the victims of the explosion were in private vehicles and taxis, and only four were walking in the area when the explosion occurred at almost 0740.  officials say initially that there were 50 persons, hit by glass shards and flying pieces of vehicles, injured in the explosion.  officials have indicated that it is possible that the number of victims will increase, as the attack against the das headquarters was very strong.  we repeat: officially, seven persons were killed here in front of the das headquarters.\n",

      "  ...the offensive of the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) as of 11 november has been militarily defeated here in the city of san salvador, as well as in san miguel, usulutan, and zacatecoluca, where there was greater activity by the subversives.  logically, after being rejected so much, after having lost so many figthers and war materiel, they do not have the capability to again launch an operation like they did on 11 november.  they will continue with indiscriminate terrorism and selective terrorism.  we have here some of the first evidence. for example, the murder of a person useful to salvadoran society like dr guerrero, the acts of sabotage against the electricity system, the destruction of public transportation.  we can also mention the destruction of some gasoline stations.  basically, what they seek is to systematically destroy the economy of the country, to provoke the closing of some industrial centers, and to bring about economic chaos.    that is why, even though we believed we were taking risks in the military field of national defense, the armed forces changed the curfew hours, so that curfew hours are now from 2300 to 0500.  we did this believing that the economic aspect is very important for the country, and that is why we want to benefit the industrial, business, and farming sectors, so that they will be able to carry out their activities under almost normal conditions.    we also considered that this time of the year we are picking coffee and cotton and harvesting sugarcane, and these are the three main staples of our economy.  these activities are mainly carried out in the evening, and that is why we have changed the curfew hours to benefit businessmen, workers, and farmers so they can support their families.    (reporter) colonel, does the president think that during the costa rican meeting enough pressure can be exerted on nicaragua so that it will suspend assistance to the fmln and the war will diminish in the country?    (ponce) the cynicism of the dictator ortega of the sandinist government has been fully proven.  in the previous meetings within the framework of esquipulas ii, he committed himself to discontinuing support for the fmln.  this total war offensive that has been inflicted upon the salvadoran people should be suspended, because we are sure that the moment nicaragua and cuba -- it is through those countries, rather those governments that the communist bloc has been helping the fmln -- the fmln would weaken tremendously.  (sentence as heard)    as a member of the armed forces, as a member of the high command, i feel very proud about the professional, determined, and courageous attitude with which the officers, non-commissioned officers, and troops of our armed forces have neutralized and defeated the fmln offensive.  in this regard, i believe that the opinions voiced by general thurman are not really in line with what we have lived here inside the country.

      "  compatriots, as you know, i came to japan to fulfill a mission in this country, which has always expressed its solidarity with colombia.    i have been, however, closely following the country's situation with deep sadness and indignation after the criminal attack on the das (administrative department of security) facilities, which deeply shook all colombians.    i have been in constant touch with carlos lemos simmons, the minister designated to act on my behalf and with my closest assistants.    in the past few days, we have experienced an increase in the vile attacks carried out by the drug trafficking criminal organization. those attacks have taken the life of many innocent colombians.  men, women, and children, who were in the prime of their lives, have been sacrificed by mad actions carried out by criminals, who intend to control an entire people, government, and country through terror and destruction.    they will not defeat us.  we are and will continue struggling.  the war has been declared on the entire country and on democracy.  we will not fall under the control of the narcoterrorists' bloody tyranny.    last night, the country learned about the colombian chamber of representatives's decision to approve the constitutional reforms with the inclusion of the extradition issue in the referendum.    the confirmation that the avianca plane crash was caused by a bomb; the murder of bernardo jaramillo uribe, roving 13th judge of criminal investigation; and this morning's atrocious attack on the das facilities further proves that the decision made by the chamber of representatives is highly unsuitable for the entire country.    we absolutely cannot accept drug traffickers trying to force our legislators to adopt a decision that would only bring more destruction and death to colombia, because if the inclusion of the extradition issue is approved in the referendum, it would not be a decision made by the sovereign will of the people, but by the force of bullets and terror.    colombians have unfortunately paid too high a price to find out what these criminals really think.  they spoke about a truce and then they murdered a judge.  subsequently, the chamber of representatives approved the inclusion of the extradition issue into the referendum and, in good faith, many people thought that was the first step toward peace with the drug traffickers.  they were wrong.  the next day the das facilities were attacked.    those actions prove what those criminals are capable of doing to obtain a favorable decision in the referendum.  they do not conduct an election campaign, but a campaign of terror to attain their goals.    i now reiterate what i said in my speech before leaving for japan. i said that the constitutional reforms with the inclusion of the referendum is highly unsuitable.    i share the sorrow and sadness of all my compatriots, especially victims' relatives.  our indignation must represent all colombians' intention to join efforts and drop personal interests.    compatriots, we must never, we will never succumb to the narcoterrorists.  the stable democracy we have built and defended with great effort for over 1 century is endangered.  throughout its history, colombia has overcome more difficult times.  let us all stand up with faith, courage, and firmness to defend our homeland and freedom.  thank you very much.\n",

      "  colombian president virgilio barco has brought forward his return to the country by 10 hours, meaning he has cancelled some events he was scheduled to attend in tokyo, and will return to the country around noon on 9 december.  he was initially scheduled to return around midnight on saturday.    president barco told the international community today that in no way will colombia accept the intervention of foreign troops to fight terrorism, violence, and organized crime.  during a news conference with japanese and foreign media representatives in tokyo, president barco also said that the liberal party will probably win the 1990 presidential elections because it has capable people and it is the majority party.  he also referred to a mid-air plane explosion -- a terrorist action, in his words -- and the attack perpetrated against the das (administrative department of security) headquarters in bogota with approximately 500 kg of explosives.    president barco will return to bogota at 0900 on 9 december.  he will depart from narita airport, located 2 hours from tokyo, (words indistinct) meeting with japanese investors and possible buyers of colombian coffee.  the event was organized by the colombian coffee growers association and the gran colombian merchant fleet's representatives in the far east.    (begin recording) (barco) approximately 2 weeks ago an airplane exploded when taking off from bogota, and experts who came from many parts of the world have discovered that it was caused by a bomb placed on board rather than a problem of pressurization.    the other case is the attack which was perpetrated last night, 2 nights ago, against the intelligence headquarters of the national police.  you have read or reported that a large amount... (changes thought) about 500 kg of dynamite placed in a truck exploded and caused the collapse or considerable damage of the general headquarters of the colombian intelligence services.    the terrorist attack was perpetrated against the offices of the das, which is -- as i said before -- where the most important intelligence activities against organized crime and drug trafficking are carried out.

      "  attention, national and international press.  this is a report from san salvador.    the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) reports that as of 2200 on 6 december, fmln columns (words indistinct) inside the capital city, staged attacks on military garrisons, and carried out sabotage activities in various parts of the country.    after breaking up the enemy's defensive positions in san salvador, the fmln occupied various areas in the capital.  the general staff installations were attacked with 60-mm mortars. (words indistinct) and air support against our positions.  we are awaiting detailed reports of this attack on the general staff with 60-mm mortars.    simultaneously, our guerrilla columns in san salvador established positions in san benito, escalon, la mascota, and maquiliguat neighborhoods, and also in san antonio abad and the northern periphery of the general staff installations, battling with marines, military detachment no. 7 from aguachapan, the elite battalions stationed there, national police forces, and units from the san benito battalion, which is in charge of guarding the general staff installations.  it is reported that one m-16 rifle, pistols, military equipment, and a large quantity of ammunition were seized from the army.    at 0100, our antiaircraft units opened fire on two helicopters in escalon neighborhood.  one of them was a transport helicopter and the other a gunship.  both were damaged.  meanwhile, our guerrillas also used mortars during an attack on the san benito battalion's positions near zona rosa.  at the same time, an attack was carried out against the cetipol (police instruction center) police academy in santa tecla, using 81-mm mortars.  attacks were staged against the cetipol's peripheral defense from another direction until late this morning.    meanwhile, an attack carried out from the northern part of san salvador led to incursions in soyapango, mejicanos, and ayutuxtepeque. in ayutuxtepeque the fmln carried out annihilation maneuvers against the 1st infantry brigade's soriano battalion, which was stationed on el carmen hill where we killed 15 soldiers and wounded 30.  among these casualties is an officer from the 1st infantry brigade.    the fmln seized five m-16 rifles, one (word indistinct) grenade launcher, (words indistinct), four m-60 machineguns from the annihilated troops.  a military vehicle was partially destroyed, and an enemy patrol was totally destroyed.    pral (long-range reconnaissance patrol) reinforcement units attempted to support the army troops under attack but they were repelled by the fmln.    the electricity system in different parts of the capital city was sabotaged, leaving 90 percent of the city without power.    attention.  here is the report on the helicopter downed in soyapango.  attention.  on 6 december there were clashes in san jose cortez, jurisdiction of soyapango, with the belloso battalion which received strong aerial support up until the afternoon hours. helicopters machinegunned and rocketed this densely populated area. our antiaircraft units, reaffirming our determination to defend the civilian population against aerial attacks, opened fire and hit a gunship.  the gunship fell to the ground at the morazan tobacco company.    guerrilla units simultaneously attacked paramilitary forces in tonacatepeque during the early hours of 7 december, which prompted aerial support because this area is on the air force's security perimeter, but calls from the battalion that was being annihilated on the el carmen hill in ayutuxtepeque went unheeded.    these are the first reports on all the activities under way in san salvador, where at 2200 on 6 december our guerrilla units began to force and break the dam that the high command built at the general staff's bunker (words indistinct) our columns, until they penetrated the aforementioned areas, fighting in the escalon and san benito neighborhoods where the oligarchs live.    actions have also taken place throughout the country.  factories have been sabotaged, strategic highways have been controlled, positions have been established, and towns have been occupied.  we will furnish further information later.\n",

      "  chilean terrorists might be involved in the kidnapping of important brazilian businessman.  this morning an antikidnapping squad of the police of sao paulo, brazil, located businessman abilio diniz, director and main shareholder of one of the largest economic groups in brazil.  abilio diniz is in the hands of a group presumed to be chilean terrorists.    five chileans were arrested last night.  another four are holding the brazilian multimillionaire in a house in the sao paulo neighborhood of jabaquara.  the kipnappers, who are said to be members of a group called chile's independence movement, demanded an unspecified sum in dollars for their guerrilla activities, an armored vehicle. weapons, and a plane to get away.    the wealthy businessman was kidnapped last monday in sao paulo by a group that drove up in ambulance as diniz was jogging in a city park. the local police honored a request from the businessman's family to keep silent to protect the victim.  police sources expressed the suspicion that the kidnappers of abilio diniz are from the same group that kidnapped the publisher luiz salles and released him after a ransom of $2.5 million was paid.\n",

      "  many political, union, university, religious, and civic organizations have been \"beheaded\" by the offensive launched by the salvadoran guerrillas a month ago, by the army's response to the offensive, and by extremist groups' retaliatory actions.    these organizations -- most of which actively favored a political solution to the salvadoran war -- have been left without main leaders because, according to party members and supporters, they have been killed, forced to hide or leave the country for \"security reasons\"    the jesuit central american university's (uca) main leaders were murdered.  according to religious organization sources, approximately 50 priests -- salvadoran and foreigners -- have left the country because they felt \"persecuted\" by the army which links them to the guerrillas.    the editorial of the 15 december edition of \"proceso\" -- a uca weekly publication -- asserts that the murder of the six jesuits on uca premises on 16 november, occurred at the same time when several churches and union headquarters were being searched by \"people in uniforms.\"    \"proceso\" mantains that \"apparently, they wanted to strike one single blow and behead every organization labeled by government propaganda as an fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) facade.\"    however, salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said before he left to attend a central american presidential summit in costa rica, that his government does not persecute religious leaders.    three days after the guerrillas started their largest offensive in the decade -- on 14 november -- guillermo ungo and hector oqueli, the main leftist opposition leaders, left el salvador, saying that they had received death threats in messages broadcast over the government's radio network.    leaders of the general confederation of workers (cgt) -- which is linked to the christian democratic party -- have reported that they are being persecuted and blame the army and the guerrillas for \"violating human rights.\"    cgt leader jose luis grande preza asserted that \"to recuperate and mantain their privileges, the extreme rightists have unscrupulously turned the army against its own people and generated repression and persecution against the church, the opposition, and union movements.\"    before leaving for guatemala to obtain support for a cease-fire in el salvador, grande preza said the guerrillas \"violate human rights in the name of revolution\" and that \"each side justifies its violence, but the only truth is that the people always end up burying the dead.\"    ludovico samayoa, deputy of the main opposition christian democratic party (pdc), asserted that two pdc municipal officials in ilobasco had been arrested by army members in the past few days. ilobasco is located 60 km northeast of san salvador.    \"the government has initiated a generalized repression to dismantle the party and frighten our members with these arrests,\" said samayoa.    human rights commission coordinator miguel montenegro said that his office, as well as other offices of organizations that oppose the government, \"were searched and destroyed by bombs\" in the eastern city of san miguel.    ignacio ellacuria, one of the six jesuits murdered on 16 november, founder of \"proceso\" and uca director, had noted a few months before his death that \"the salvadoran political process had entered a new phase of moderation and flexibility with the increase of political spaces.\"    in contrast the editorial that appears in the next edition of \"proceso\" stresses: \"it is the hour of the long knives.  the malestrom of blood that has come upon the country in the past month has shred to pieces the phase of moderation in which the main participants of the salvadoran political process had been involved.\"\n",

      "  from 10 to 12 december, presidents of five central american countries held a special meeting to mediate between the salvadoran government and guerrillas.  but so far no agreement has been reached by both sides on bringing about a cease-fire during christmas.  their 1-month-long fierce battle has left 3,000 people dead and also cast a shadow over the central american peace process.    the current civil war in el salvador was triggered off by the destruction of the headquarters of the labor federation, the country's biggest trade union organization.  on 31 october, an ultrarightist \"dare-to-die squad\" supported by the government and the military used a heavy bomb to bombard the headquarters building of the labor federation, killing and wounding over 40 people including principal leaders of the federation.  on 2 november, the guerrillas issued a statement strongly condemning the terrorist activity of the squad and declaring the cancellation of the third round of talks with the government scheduled in venezuela.  on the same night the guerrillas launched a large-scale offensive \"to eliminate fascism.\"  about 8,000 guerrillas swiftly captured many towns and strategic positions northwest of the capital and cut key communications lines between the capital and the hinterland.  in the meantime, they also attacked some 50 government army bases and police stations in the hinterland, thus controlling 30 percent of the country's territory.  they have established \"local people's governments\" in 8 of the 14 provinces throughout the country.  during this period, the government dispatched armored cars and air force units to carry out counterattacks.  they wantonly bombarded the residential areas near the capital city occupied by the guerrillas.  after 8 days of fierce battle, the guerrillas shot down 12 government fighter planes and helicopters; destroyed 34 tanks, armored cars, and patrol cars; and captured a large amount of arms and ammunition.  subsequently battles continued in regions outside the capital city.  since early december both sides have engaged in fierce battles in the capital city and the hinterland. the guerrillas used mortars to attack the building of the government army general staff headquarters, the u.s.  embassy, and the presidential restaurant, whereas the government army dispatched planes to bombard the guerrilla positions.  fierce battles have also broken out in chalatenango, san miguel, and other towns, thereby causing heavy casualties and property losses.    this war has deep-rooted causes.  el salvador is a small country with an area of 21,000 square km and a population of 5 million. during this 10-year-long war, 70,000 people have died and the national economy has been seriously destroyed.  the ultrarightist nationalist republican alliance (arena) won the general election early this year, thus aggravating the conflict between the guerrillas and the government.  prior to the election, the guerrillas put forward a peace proposal demanding six months' posponement of the election so as to make their participation possible.  but this proposal was rejected by the government.  because almost half of the voters did not vote, the guerrillas declared it did not recognize the cristiani government. pressed by domestic public opinion and urged by the central american peace agreement, the government and the guerrillas held two rounds of talks in september and october.  during their talks the guerrillas demanded that the government stop its suppression, introduce political, economic, and judicial reforms, reorganize the armed forces, and punish the \"dare-to-die squad.\"  the government insisted that the guerrillas should lay down their arms before reforms were carried out.  the hard-line position of the government reflected the established policy of the ruling party, which has all along stood for ruling the country by military means, advocated the suppression of democratic forces, and supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in carrying out assassination.  a university president in central america was assassinated by the squad for criticizing the ultrarightist policy of the ruling party.  recently the ruling party supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in attacking the labor federation's building. this ignited the current civil war and undermined the peace process in the country. the guerrillas issued a statement on 12 december condemning the meeting of the five heads of state for being partial to the ultrarightist salvadorian government.  they made it clear that they would not accept any effort to dissolve the guerrilla forces and would carry on their struggle.

      "  the police have reported that tomas evangelista, a leader of the ruling american popular revolutionary alliance (apra) and director of the ayacucho development corporation, was shot dead by terrorists here today.    the police said that a group of hooded individuals early this morning entered evangelista's house and, after tying the hands of his wife and five children, took evangelista out of the house and shot him at least 20 times.    evangelista, who was 50 years old, had held the most important regional apra posts for 30 years.    evangelista's wife told the police that before her husband was killed, the hooded man shouted their support for the pro-maoist shining path terrorist group.  anthropologist abimael guzman, the founder of the shining path terrorist organization, was evangelista's professor at the huamanga university in ayacucho.    the national police have also reported that on 26 january shining path terrorists murdered brothers martiza and john paolo puzo ochoa and their mother marta ochoa in the township of campina, 60 km south of ayacucho.    witnesses told the police that the ochoas were killed because they refused to supply food and lodging to the terrorists.    more than 200 people have died so far this month owing to the armed struggle that the shining path terrorists began in 1980 and that has already claimed the lives of at least 17,700 people and caused damage of over $16 billion, which is the equivalent to the 70 percent of the peruvian foreign debt.\n",

      "  we are saying hello at this hour to north santander governor eduardo assaf elcure.  dr assaf, good day.    (assaf) good morning, rcn (station call sign).    (reporter) mr. governor, what information does the departmental administration have about events dealing with public order, such as regrettable incident in arboledas (murder of arboledas mayor pedro jesus hernandez).    (assaf) the official reports on the regrettable case in arboledas at noon today, and those carried by rcn and other stations, describing the way in which mayor pedro jesus hernandez was murdered while inaugurating a dining hall for children at juan bueno, arboledas municipality, lead us to believe that something extremely serious is happening.  hernandez was going to inaugurate on 20-25 february four or five works that are important for the development of the communities and had been demanded by them for a long time.  this leads us to believe that the situation is really difficult and that other measures will have to be adopted to prevent a continuation of these regrettable actions, which destabilize public order in the department.    i think that after the peace talks with m-19 (19 april movement) are concluded next week, dr. octavio pardo should in some way promote a truce with the national liberation army (eln) and the epl (popular liberation army) to see if it is possible to begin a dialogue and keep the bloodshed from continuing in our country, most particularly in our department.  over the course of a month, two mayors, who were characterized as the fightingest mayors -- in the sense that they launched, executed, and completed works -- have been killed in our department.    (reporter) mr. governor, how many mayors did you say have been killed during that time?    (assaf) what did you say?    (repoerter) mr. governor, do you believe that, for instance, civic or political leaders in the area of north santander can participate in talks with the epl and the eln to make serious proposals to the government about a possible truce, as you suggest?    (assaf) in view of our current situation, that is, in view of the fact that a month ago the mayor of abrego was killed and the arboledas mayor was killed yesterday, i believe that the country is pleased that the pacification process with m-19 will end this week.  so, why not look for avenues of communication with the (1-second break in reception) and the epl to establish a truce, at least during this electoral period, so that all colombians, especially those of north santander, can freely exercise their sovereign right to participate in an election and express their satisfaction with or condemnation of the people who are currently governing the municipalities?

      "  the salvadoran armed forces denied today that their planes had bombed a refugee camp and civilian settlements in the departments of chalatenango and morazan, located north and northeast of san salvador, as religious sources had reported yesterday.    a communique released by the armed forces states that five persons, including four minors, were killed, not as a result of the bombings, \"but as a result of the clashes\" between soldiers and guerrillas at the \"corral de las piedras\" refugee camp in chalatenango department.    the armed forces accused the guerrillas of firing rockets \"that hit several houses,\" and it reported that a soldier and six guerrillas were killed in the clashes, which lasted between 0600 and 1400.    however, eduardo alas, the bishop of chalatenango, told the media today that five people were killed and at least 14 civilians were wounded when the camp was attacked from the air.    \"according to the entire community,\" alas said, \"a rocket or a grenade-type device fell on one of the houses with many people inside, including children.  i saw the mutilated bodies of the children and holes in the roof.  there was a lot of machinegun fire.\"    moreover, the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) condemned the \"cowardly attack\" on the refugee homes, which, he said, were \"higly visible and identified as civilian housing.\"    \"this incident shows a total lack of commitment by the armed forces to reach a negotiated solution, and it reaffirms the need to maintain the armed struggle and to use military power to reach a negotiated solution so that human rights are respected,\" the fmln said in a communique released today.    the fmln also condemned an alleged bombing of the town of cacaopera, in morazan department, which the armed forces have denied.    according to the guerrillas, a woman was wounded and a sugar cane harvest was destroyed by the bombs, but according to col mauricio vargas, military chief of the region, \"there was no bombing, but clashes with a group of guerrillas with the support of helicopters.\"    the military chief promised, however, to carry out the \"pertinent investigations to learn what happened in the region.\"\n",

      "  defense minister gen. hector alejandro gramajo spoke on 7 february at a news conference just a few hours after learning of a new guerrilla attack that took place at daybreak on 7 february, against the tecpan, chimaltenango police garrison. the guerrillas stole four .38 caliber revolvers, four m-1 carbines, and .30 caliber ammunition and took police patrol car no.  ch-02.    during wednesday's news conference, the army released a summary of guerrilla activities starting in early december, when subverisve commandos destroyed the bridge spanning the coyolate river.  during a four-day period in december, the guerrillas sabotaged an electrical tower outside the capital and set fire to a vehicle belonging to the technical-agricultural training institute on the road to solola.    two more acts of sabotage against electrical installations took place the first week in january.  a few days later, three government-owned vehicles were set on fire -- one belonging to bandesa (national agriculrural development bank) and two belonging to the public health ministry, which were transporting vaccines to a clinic. during the last days of january, there was another act of sabotage against the electrical system in quezaltenango and an attack on the village of pochuta that caused personal injuries and property damage.    since the weekend, a post at the kilometer 42 road mark along route ca-9 was attacked and a civilian was killed.  at daybreak on 14 february, the national police garrison at tecpan, chimaltenango was attacked, but no casualties were reported.    according to the minister of defense, the leftist guerrillas' new directives came from a recent meeting held in a central american country, which the military commander did not identify.

(end recording)    according to gen. gramajo, some rivalries have started among the different guatemalan national revolutionary unity (urng) groups, such is the case of the rebel armed forces (far) who have penetrated areas were the revolutionary organization of the people in arms (orpa) operated, such as the areas of pachlum, peten, and godinez.  orpa now maintains itself south of chimaltenango, in the northern area of escuintla and sacatepequez.  the poor people's guerrilla army (egp) centers its actions against bases.    the defense minister also explained the army's position concerning the possibility of reinitiating talks with guerrilla representatives.    (begin recording) (gramajo) as you may have noticed, we only refer to the three groups in which they operate.  however, we are only talking about armed activities.  the constitution says that there cannot be armed bands and (words indistinct) in combat zones.  (words indistinct) euphemisms: dialogue, talks, and conferences.  this, however, is not a matter that concerns us.  we have been very clear in this sense.  we have serious reservations about the validity of a conference, or talks, or whatever that has only been used as a tactical instrument at a specific moment.  el salvador has suffered much in this regard.

      "  salvadoran president alfredo cristiani today said the government is awaiting a reply from the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) regarding a possible resumption of the dialogue.    cristiani held a news conference at the comalapa airport this morning prior to traveling to taiwan on a tour which, he said, will last until 3 march.    cristiani disclosed that as part of his mediation efforts, the un secretary general has twice sent his personal delegate, alvaro de soto, who has been told that the salvadoran government demands that the fmln halt its hostilities and sabotage activity aimed at disrupting national commerce.    \"we know,\" president cristiani said, \"that the fmln has asked for two weeks to study and respond to our latest proposal.\"    the president referred to an attack last night and early this morning on an electric power substation in northwestern san salvador, describing it as \"a publicity ploy to impress the un secretary general.\"    \"we are insisting on a halt to hostilities\" because of such actions, which \"constitute only terrorism and do not represent a military threat,\" the president said.    the president denied that the government is looking for economic aid in other regions because of the suspension of frg aid and because of the possibility of u.s. aid cuts.    \"this visit to taiwan had been scheduled since before the guerrilla offensive in november.  i received the invitation from the taiwan government when i took office in june,\" cristiani said.    he added that the objective of the visit is to strengthen relations and trade with a friendly government as well as to express thanks for the technical assistance taiwan has provided.    regarding aid from the frg, he said \"efforts are being made to reestablish it.  the frg government is conditioning its aid on respect for human rights and the development of the democratic process in the country.\"    referring to u.s. aid, the salvadoran president said he is not aware that official decisions or plans exist.  instead, there are personal positions of congressmen or special-interest groups, but this must be fully discussed at the time of the vote for the next fiscal year, which in the united states begins in october.    the president also defended the recent economic measures, which have led to protests against the general increase in prices of staples.  he said these measures were necessary for the country's economy, which was affected last year, first, by the overall cuts in u.s. aid to the region, a reduction of $55 million for el salvador; second, by the drop in international coffee prices, which caused $150 million in losses for el salvador; and third, by the damage from the guerrilla offensive in november.    before leaving on his trip and in response to newsmen's questions, president cristiani also defended the armed forces, stating that the actions in which they have been involved recently have not weakened them and, on the contrary, have strengthened the armed forces because errors have been admitted and those responsible are being prosecuted, such as in the cases of the jesuits and the civilians who were killed on 11 february in chalatenango.    cristiani said that in the latter case there have been no pressures and that from the moment that there was news about the tragedy, the commission that investigates criminal acts was ordered to undertake the appropriate investigation to determine the cause of the tragedy. he said it concluded that the tragedy was caused by a helicopter rocket, but there was no bombing, although the civilians were victims of war actions.    cristiani criticized the fmln for waging battles in populated areas because this endangers civilians.    in conclusion, cristiani said the fmln will never give up its attempts to weaken or divide the armed forces, but he added that the armed forces are becoming more professional every day.\n",

      "  the nicaraguan contras charged in tegucigalpa today that on 19 february the sandinist air force used airplanes and helicopters to bomb several communities in zelaya, matagalpa, and jinotega departments, in central and northern nicaragua.    the rebels did not report any dead or wounded in the alleged attacks, which the contras say are part of an offensive begun in the days prior to the elections, scheduled for sunday, 25 february.    in a communique, the contras indicated that their fighters are not attacking sandinist military targets, and that the purpose of the nicaraguan military action was to \"create confusion\" regarding the electoral process.    on the other hand, commander \"franklin\" of the nicaraguan resistance (rn) general staff said that the rn will remain \"intact,\" even in the event that the elections are won by violeta de chamorro, candidate of the national opposition union (uno).    \"we will remain intact to see if there is a total transmission of power on 25 april, in which the new government will make in-depth reforms, particularly the elimination of the repressive system,\" he added.    the rn military chief said that if the sandinists win or \"steal\" the elections, there will be a \"social uprising\" in nicaragua against the system, and there will be \"a harsher struggle than that of past years.\"    \"franklin\" said that the sandinists have deployed some 30,000 troops to departments in northern nicaragua to \"intimidate and murder\" uno sympathizers.  he emphasized that the contras will not put down their weapons, because the cause that led to the creation of those forces -- the sandinists' ascent to power -- \"has not yet disappeared,\" and \"the repression continues.\"    he added that his fighters are willing to leave the camps in eastern honduras if the honduran government requests that they do so, but their families would remain.\n",

      "  colombian government minister carlos lemos has hinted that it may have been members of the marxist guerrilla group army of national liberation (eln) who have murdered the 77 followers of the left-wing party the patriotic union (up).    lemos said: i can expect anything from the eln.  he added that he believed that this group makes no exceptions when it wants to kill someone.    the up has blamed president virgilio barco's government and the military for the annihilation campaign against its members, demanding guarantees for their political activities with less than two weeks before the 11 march legislative elections take place.    the up made the report following the murder on 26 february of apartado mayor diana cordoba saldarriaga -- apartado is located 480 km to the northeast of bogota -- and the murder on the evening of 27 february of six more up followers in unguia, a village in choco department.  when blaming the eln, the government minister said that these individuals want to bring anarchy and instability to the country.  lemos added that as part of the eln's destablization campaign, it would not be difficult to imagine that they would have the murder people of other left-wing sectors as their goal, and admitted that there has been a series of threats against various government officials, including himself.  when referring to the up's reports holding the military responsible, he said that this was absurd and added that it is intended to lead the investigations astray and to try to stop the elections in colombia.\n",

      "  military sources reported today that fighting broke out on the night of 5 march in the war-torn chalatenango department to the north of san salvador, where the guerrillas suffered eight casualties.    the armed forces press committee reported that the clashes took place near san isidro labrador, where three guerrillas were killed and five others were wounded.    the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln), which has been fighting the u.s.-backed army for the last 10 years, has traditionally maintained a high profile in strategic areas of chalatenango.    meanwhile, urban guerrilla commandos harassed troops belonging to the 1st infantry brigade last night at the mariona penitentiary, located on the northern outskirts of san salvador, apparently leaving no casualties.    atlacatl battalion troops, which maintain a counterinsurgency operation at the foothills of guazapa hill, to the north of san salvador, confiscated war materiel that the guerrillas had hidden underground.    in another turn of events, fmln sappers who continuously sabotage the electrical power system destroyed several high-voltage posts in la libertad and cabanas departments in the central part of the country, and in usulutan department in the southeastern part of the country.    there were widespread power outages in the three departments while technicians of the state-run electric power companies repaired the damage.    the army and security corps deployed heavy patrols in san salvador and in cities in the country's interior to try and counter the wave of attacks.\n",

      "  good evening, listeners.  in order to bring calm to all san salvador residents, and also to people living in the interior of the country, we inform you that a few minutes ago, experts of the electric light company of el salvador, caes, confirmed that despite a few attacks on some power towers, energy service is completely normal throughout san salvador.  the caes experts added that there was a short power outage in large parts of san salvador, but that the situation is back to normal now.  the experts said that they also detected some damage in the energy system.    as you may have heard on this radio station earlier, harassment operations were carried out in several parts of san salvador at approximately 2115 tonight.    farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) leftist guerrillas attacked military positions in san ramon, ayutuxtepeque, mejicanos, and cuscatancingo tonight.  it was said that a number of fmln members conducted lightning attacks on those military positions and then withdrew from the area immediately.    it was reported that the attack in san ramon lasted approximately 15 minutes, after which the army took control of that entire area. reports state that after the attack in ayutuxtepeque the guerrillas moved toward el carmen hill and counterinsurgency battalion members were pursuing the rebel columns there.  it was also reported that the rebels attacked military positions in cuscatancingo and on el fito street, mejicanos jurisdiction.    a few minutes ago it was reported that the shooting ended in ayutuxtepeque and in the other parts of northern san salvador, and that an air force helicopter is overflying the area to counteract the rebels' movement.    it was also confirmed that energy has been restored in some parts of san salvador, but not in cuscatancingo and ciudad delgado, where the guerrillas blew up several power towers.    the armed forces press committee (coprefa) has only stated that no casualties are reported as a result of these harassment operations, especially in the area of ayutuxtepeque.  coprefa indicated that 1st infantry brigade members have already taken strategic positions throughout northern san salvador and that these men are supported by salvadoran air force helicopters, which are lighting the area with spotlights and flares.    according to the official report, the situation at this time is completely normal in northern san salvador, despite the panic that spread at approximately 2115 when heavy shooting, machinegun fire, and the detonation of powerful bombs were heard.    neither coprefa nor the specific military positions that were attacked have reported casualties so far.  it was said that tomorrow morning coprefa will issue an overall report on the results of these clashes.  salvadoran red cross sources said tonight that they do not know of any civilian casualty resulting from these armed incidents.    this has been a report on the attacks carried out in northern san salvador tonight.  we invite you to join us tomorrow for a report on the development of events.\n",

      "  the general command of the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) deems as positive the government's recognition of the fmln's good-will gestures.  however, we view as a negative that in the government's response there is not a corresponding attitude. in this regard, we inform:    1.  the government response tries to undermine our gesture.  the fmln has never had a policy to attack or harm the civilian population. our gestures are a clear contribution to strengthening the space of other political and social forces to allow for their participation in the political negotiation solution process and in the effort to humanize the conflict.    2.  the government and the armed forces continue to violate human rights, bomb civilian populated areas, subject the country to a permanent state of siege, be it legal or de facto.  in a constant and systematic manner, the government maintains a policy of capturing and torturing leaders of people's groups; maintains sieges and raids; harasses the communities of repatriates; and sabotages the property of residents in areas under the fmln control.    in the meantime, no step has been taken to investigate and punish the murder of monsignor romero and the massacre of fenastras (salvadoran workers national union federation), while the trial against the murderers of the jesuit priests has stagnated and the suspects are promoted or sent abroad.    the government intends to appoint as defense minister the person who gave the order to murder the priests, and it allows the reported executioner to live in a luxury apartment.    3.  we agree with the permanent, serious, important, and reserved character that the negotiation process should have.    4.  the government is morally and politically compelled to implement as soon as possible goodwill gestures that will permit the exercise of citizen's freedoms and cease the daily human rights violations and all forms of aggression aimed at the civilian population.    5.  we warn that it would be regrettable for the people's peace and democracy hopes that the government and the armed forces try to harden warmongering positions, believing in the mirage of an alleged weakness of the fmln.  obviously, this mistake would only lead to a worsening of the war and would further delay the possibilities of negotiations, democratization, and peace for el salvador.    fmln general command    (signed) commander shafik jorge handal, commander eduardo sancho, commander salvador sanchez ceren, commander francisco jovel, commander joaquin villalobos    (issued in) el salvador, 15 march 1990\n",

      "  the salvadoran armed forces charged today that a group of guerrillas attacked a contingent of soldiers in the town of victoria, northeastern cabanas department, from a settlement for displaced persons.  there were no casualties.    the armed forces press committee (coprefa) has stated that the rebels fired m-60 machineguns at a patrol of soldiers passing by the santa marta settlement, where some 3,000 displaced persons live.    the military report said that the incident took place on 15 march and the soldiers did not answer the fire.    however, the christian committee for displaced salvadorans (cripdes) denied that there are any armed persons in this settlement, where the persons who recently came back from the honduran camp of mesa grande are living.    tomasa ruiz, spokesperson for cripdes, said that the charges \"are a direct threat\" to the security of the displaced persons in santa marta.  \"this does not mean,\" she added, \"that there are no confrontations taking place outside the camp, but there are no armed persons inside the camp.\"    the armed forces have said that the guerrillas are hiding among the civilian population in order to attack the soldiers.    on 11 february, one adult and four minors were killed and 16 others were wounded when a salvadoran air force helicopter strafed a camp of displaced persons in corral de piedras, chalatenango department.  on that occasion the army said that the guerrillas attacked the government troops from the settlement of refugees who returned to the country late last year, after having lived nearly one decade in the honduran camps.    in addition, the armed forces said that three soldiers had been wounded during fighting with the guerrillas in the town of san jose guayabal, in the central cuscatlan department.    these charges were made public on 16 march when the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) announced a suspension of sabotage actions on public transportation, business establishments, and the telecommunications center, as well as attacks on civilian officials.    the army also maintained that the rebels blew up five electricity posts in san vicente and morazan department in the center and northeastern parts of the country.  the rebels also harassed soldiers who were guarding an electricity station in a town of santa ana department and a military checkpoint on the bridge over the acelhuate river in aguilares, north of san salvador.    according to the military report, these harassment actions by the rebels did not cause any casualties.\n",

      "  tension prevailed this evening in the capital after the body of patriotic union (up) candidate bernardo jaramillo ossa was transferred to the oval room in the national congress, where he will lie in state until his funeral on 24 march.    bogota mayor andres pastrana arango decreed a dry law at noon, and suspended classes in private and public elementary and high schools tomorrow, 23 march.    the president attended a security council meeting at natino palace and the military commanders talked with journalists when leaving the premises.  defense minister oscar botero said that the medellin cartel planned and carried out the assassination upon instructions from pablo escobar gaviria, who made a down payment of 300,000 pesos to andres arturo gutierrez, the assassin hired to perpetrate the crime.    the assassin, a 16-year-old youth, is recovering from his wounds and, in a preliminary declaration to the authorities, he confirmed who ordered the assassination.    moreover, das (administrative department of security) detective edison sanchez mendieta, who was wounded this morning at the airport terminal, was released this afternoon.    referring to the way in which the weapon was smuggled into the airport, the authorities said that this issue is being thoroughly investigated by security organizations -- because it could have been assembled inside the premises or smuggled in with the complicity of a maintenance worker.    riots, clashes, and the burning of tires and five buses was reported in several higher education centers of bogota, such as the free university, the pedagogical university, the national university; and in neighborhoods such as policarpa salavarrieta, garces navas, and soacha.  these actions resulted in the wounding of a policeman, whose condition is still critical.    teachers who are members of fecode (colombian federation of educators) have ordered a two-day strike starting tomorrow.  banana farm workers in uraba, where the assassinated leader worked as a labor lawyer, reacted similarly.    transportation activities have noticeably decreased in the capital since the mayor urged the citizenry to go home early in the evening.    the assassinated candidate's body is currently lying in state in the oval room of the national congress.\n",

      "  the maoist shining path terrorist organization and the tupac amaru revolutionary movement (mrta) are staging attacks in an attempt to make the people boycott the 8 april peruvian elections.    a bomb exploded early this morning near the house of health minister paul caro gamarra.  caro's wife said that the house, which is in the port of el callao, lacks police protection.    the headquarters of the center-rightist democratic front (fredemo), whose presidential candidate is the writer mario vargas llosa, was bombed last night.  the mrta claimed the attack through leaflets left at the scene.    the mrta also planted explosives and left leaflets beside five fredemo placards.    forty members of fredemo were at the headquarters, which is on an important lima avenue, when the attack occurred.  nobody was injured. david cifuentes, a deputy candidate of the ruling american popular revolutionary alliance (apra) today said that there is a terrorist plot to kill the presidential candidates.    on 14 march cifuentes escaped unharmed from an attack on the car in which he was travelling.  his bodyguard died in the attack which occurred 40 km from the city of cajamarca.    the terrorists placed big stones at a curve in the road which caused the vehicle to run off the road.  the attackers then opened fire on the car.    cifuentes fell out of the vehicle and broke his arm in two places, and is now in hospital.    shining path members recently murdered 19 people, including 10 children, in a small village near huancayo city, 415 km south of lima. this act clearly shows that the maoists are determined to continue killing and destroying.    some 300 people were murdered by the shining path during the boycott of the municipal elections on 12 november 1989.    the attacks perpetrated by the mrta last night belies the alleged announcement that they will cease to use violence.  this announcement was published by a local newspaper two days ago.    united left deputy gustavo espinosa, in a statement to the daily onda, said that if the mrta is truly seeking a political way to turn in their weapons \"they would contribute to the pacification of the country.\"    however, espinosa said that one cannot consider an end to the violence until there is more proof of their announcement.    during the past 10 years, the shining path and the mrta have perpetrated more than 16,000 attacks which have caused damage estimated at $10,000.  this estimate was prepared by the congressional commission in charge of assessing the effects and causes of political violence in peru.    during president alan garcia's term of office the terrorists have perpetrated 10,621 attacks, which represents an average of more than six attacks per day during his five years in power.    fatal victims of political violence amount to approximately 19,000, of which 700 have died during 1990.\n",

      "  the national police have reported that the \"patriotic liberation front\" (frente patriotico de liberacion) bombed three important public buildings in lima today, causing a lot of property damage but no casualties.    a police source reported that groups from this new terrorist movement attacked the city hall of san juan de miraflores, on the outskirts of lima; an electrolima (lima electric power enterprise) office; and an entelperu (national telecommunications enterprise of peru) office in the miraflores and surco districts of lima. the source added: \"this new terrorist organization wants to intimidate the people to prevent them from exercising their right to vote on election day (8 april).\"    in these elections the people will elect the president of the republic, two vice presidents, 180 deputies, and 60 senators.  it is believed that at least 10 million peruvians will vote.    up to now the police have attributed the most serious attacks and crimes to the maoist \"shining path\" group and the marxist \"tupac amaru revolutionary movement\" (mrta). the \"shining path\" and the \"mrta\" are responsible for the deaths of at least 700 people this year, including a dozen candidates for congressional seats and regional assemblies and some thirty members of the security forces.\n",

      "  the attacks on five offices of the democratic front (fredemo), which is headed by mario vargas llosa, on the office of the ruling american popular revolutionary alliance, apra, and against one telephone exchange, two banks, one store, and one movie theater, show that terrorism in peru continues to be used in an attempt to boycott the 8 april elections.    one girl was wounded during the explosions that occurred in lima yesterday, and four individuals were arrested while looting two shoe stores and a market and urging people to join them.    the attacks seriously damaged the offices of the political parties, especially that of the fredemo, but no one was injured.    the pagina libre newspaper today reported that seven alleged members of the movement of the revolutionary left (mir) were arrested in the city of trujillo, 570 km north of lima.  the mir is a faction of the pro-guevara tupac amaru revolutionary movement (mrta).    the maoist shining path terrorist organization has called for \"an armed strike\" -- a strike under threat of death -- in lima tomorrow. this is the third armed strike to be called by this organization so far this month.    a 48-hour armed strike was called in ayacucho, the birthplace of the shining path organization and the other one in huanta.    president alan garcia yesterday delivered 170 patrol cars to the national police.  he urged the police to resolutely face the increasing wave of terrorism and to make use of all available resources.    the national police yesterday commissioned a squad of 16 motorcycles to patrol the city and to go directly to the sites of attacks.    it is expected that subversives will increase the number of attacks in a wave of terror before the elections and this is why the police and military forces have been put on alert.    about 100,000 policemen have been put on alert throughout the country following the murder last week of four candidates for deputies, an apra leader, and the managers of several businesses in lima, and other cities.    lima and callao have been placed in a state of emergency, which means that individual guarantees have been suspended.    yesterday ayacucho was left in darkness after a shining path attack.  at least three people were killed, several were wounded, and various arrests were made by the police.    yesterday was the most violent day in ayacucho since last november when municipal elections were held.  the elections were then annulled because of the high number of null and blank votes.    last week in huancayo, 415 km southeast of lima, an apra candidate for deputy was murdered.  yesterday an individual was wounded when a car bomb exploded causing extensive material damage.    yesterday in chiclayo, in northern peru, a bomb was thrown at the house of fredemo candidate for deputy miguel angel bartra, who was not in the house at the time.    in la libertad department a terrorist group took over the guadalupito town early yesterday morning in an effort to find the local apra secretary general and the town's mayor.    when the terrorists could not find them, they blew up the offices of the municipality and the power station causing an outage in the zone.    the strikes affecting 100,000 workers in the country continue and the strikers have rejected the \"labor truce\" until the elections are over that had been requested by interior minister agustin mantilla.    mantilla said that the strikes \"are bordering on the seditious and the criminal.\"    in the last 10 years political violence in peru has caused 19,000 deaths, of which 700 have occurred so far this year.\n",

      "  five soldiers were killed and five were wounded during a fierce guerrilla attack this morning in the city of suchitoto, cuzcatlan department, in the central part of the country, military spokespersons have reported.    the sources indicated that the rebel attack by rifle fire began at 0120 today and lasted for four hours.  after this, the army was in control of the situation.  the number of rebel casualties is not known.    the fighting began when farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) guerrillas attacked the las guaras bridge guard post in the city of suchitoto, 44 km from san salvador.    the military sources said that early this morning the army was in control of the situation.  however, artillery units are conducting a combing operation in an effort to capture the rebels.    guerrillas activities have increased over the past few days after the fmln signed an agreement with the government last wednesday in geneva (switzerland) to continue the dialogue to resolve the 10-year conflict in the country.    fmln guerrillas attacked armed forces positions in the northern and southern parts of the capital for more than a half hour yesterday, resulting in two rebels being killed and one wounded, according to military reports.    the fmln has also intensified its sabotage of electricity pylons, above all in the capital.  this week the fmln rebels brought down at least 20 electricity pylons, causing power outages in different parts of the country.\n",

      "  the criminal drug mafias operating in colombia announced today that they will increase their terrorist attacks on \"the industrial and political oligarchy\" in response to the alleged disappearance of several of their accomplices.    in a communique sent by telefax to several news media, \"the extraditables,\" spokesmen for the mafias, said that their \"war\" will be carried out henceforth because of the \"disappearance, torture, and assassination\" of several drug traffickers at the hands of the directorate of judicial police and investigations (dijin).    according to the criminals, who again described themselves as a \"political-military\" organization, \"the problem of the extradition has been relegated to a secondary status, since our main motive for the war will be the torture, assassination, and disappearance of our comrades.\"    a few days ago, in a similar message, the criminals said that they would place 5-ton dynamite bombs in \"neighborhoods of the bogota oligarchy,\" in reprisal for offensive actions by the authorities.    yesterday, a car-bomb with 800 kg of dynamite was left by drug traffickers in an exclusive sector of the capital.  had it not been for a defect in the detonator, it would have killed at least 5,000 (number as received) people.    according to the criminals, the resurgence of terrorist attacks is due to the \"disappearance\" late last month of jose retavista garzon, freddy lopez ospina, and brothers omar and guillermo perea rivera, who reportedly were arrested by the police in the northwestern town of envigado.    however, according to an investigation carried out yesterday by the attorney general's office, these persons are not confined in any garrison of the elite force, a police antiterrorist corps.    \"the extraditables\" noted that \"the good faith of the attorney general's office in no way satisfies our demands, because the missing companions were taken out of the school (police headquarters) and executed by order of dijin director oscar pelaez carmona, whom they accuse of \"masterminding\" several massacres.    the drug trafficking mafia also said that the killings of policemen had been suspended (14 uniformed policemen have been killed in medellin since last monday) and that they had never participated in \"torture,\" but, they added, \"we will intensify our struggle against the industrial and political oligarchy, which is an accomplice to the assassinations.\"    the war against the drug mafias in colombia, which appears to have experienced a violent resurgence, began last august after mercenaries at the service of the criminal groups assassinated in the space of a few hours a magistrate, a police colonel, and presidential hopeful luis carlos galan.\n",

      "  the \"shining path\" terrorist organization is keeping three peruvian cities under pressure with three \"armed strikes\"-- strikes enforced by death threats--that began today in an effort to force a boycott of tomorrow's general elections.    ayacucho, the capital of the southern department of ayacucho, is under a state of military emergency.  there is neither electricity nor water in the city, and every activity has been suspended as a result of the three-day \"armed strike\" called as of today.  there is no transportation either, stores are closed, and the streeets are patrolled by the army and the military police.  roads linking ayacucho with the departmental provinces of cangallado and la mar were blocked by shining path terrorists with stones and tree trunks.  the 55-km road linking ayacucho with the city of huanta is guarded by 4,000 members of the \"peasant patrols,\" which are opposed to the \"shining path.\"  there are a few vans on the road, under military surveillance. \"shining path\" terrorists have destroyed a suspension bridge linking ayacucho with the province of julcamarca, which was thus forced into isolation.    candidates for deputy from ayacucho department for the ruling apra (american popular revolutionary alliance), the vargas llosa-led democratic front (fredemo), and the united left, as well as foreign and local journalists who will covering the election in that area are all lodged in a hotel in ayacucho.  \"shining path\" has threatened to blow up the hotel, which is heavily guarded by the police.    meanwhile, the people of ayacucho are checking the voter lists to find out where each voter will have to cast his vote tomorrow.    the shining path also called for an \"armed strike\" from today until monday in huaraz, capital of the ancash department, bordering lima department to the north.  the city was paralyzed and in the dark following the destruction of a high-tension pylon six km from the city.  as the result of that attack, five provinces of ancash were left without electricity.    the shining path terrorists hurled explosives at a market in huaraz, injuring 15 people.  the huaraz-lima road was blocked for 15 hours when shining path guerrillas set two trucks loaded with minerals on fire.  ancash department lies outside the area under the state of emergency that encompasses half of peru, including the metropolitan lima area.    huancayo, 415 km southeast of lima, is completely paralyzed by the \"armed strike\" imposed by the shining path. all activities-- banks, commerce, markets, public transportation--have been suspended. since friday there have been eight bombings of public and private facilities.  a car was destroyed by a bomb.  the city's electricity supply has been cut, following the destruction of three high-tension pylons.  also affected was the electricity supply in the entire mantaro river valley, where the country's largest hydroelectric plant is located. this plant supplies 80 percent of peru's electricity.    since last year, shining path terrorists have been extending their activities from the department of ayacucho to the strategic department of junin, bordering the department of lima. junin provides most of lima's food.\n",

      "  the government has announced a total offensive to capture medellin cartel boss pablo escobar gaviria following the death yesterday of nine people in an attack by the extraditables in medellin.    the offensive was announced at the end of an urgent meeting of the security council called by government minister horacio serpa uribe, who is acting president because of president virgilio barco's trip to nicaragua to attend the inauguration of president violeta chamorro.    serpa said that escobar has become enemy no. one and noted that all of the authorities' efforts are now centered on his capture. the minister said that escobar is behind the violence onslaught and asked the population to cooperate with the authorities' efforts to capture him. \"pablo escobar is behind the violence onslaught,\" the government minister said.    nine people died and approximately 50 were wounded when a car loaded with 200 kg of dynamite exploded in a heavily populated district in medellin known as las americas. police sources said that the car bomb, which was camouflaged with construction waste, was set off by remote control at a passing elite police patrol.    the explosion seriously damaged over 10 private vehicles and at least three buses with passengers as well as a dozen business establishments and private residences.    defense minister general oscar botero restrepo said that the attack was the work of the extraditables, the armed wing of the medellin cartel, one of the biggest drug processing and drug trafficking organizations in the world. medellin, colombia's second largest city, is the home of the cartel and of its armed wing--the extraditables--which described themselves in march as a political-military organization and declared war on the colombian state.    the extraditables announced at the time that they were relegating their struggle to prevent the extradition of colombians to the united states to second place and that their top priority would be to fight the state, the oligarchy and the members of the police who kidnap, torture and murder the members of their organization and their families.    yesterday's attack was the second to be carried out against colombia's special antidrug and counterinsurgency elite police corps. on 11 march another car bomb loaded with over 100 kg of dynamite was exploded against a police vehicle on the freeway south of medellin. eight policemen and nine civilians were killed in the explosion.\n",

      "  colombians, during these months of national tragedy we have been hit by events over and over again.  violence strikes the hearts of our institutions, values, democracy, and our best men.  the ultimate goal of those engaged in violence is to prevent democracy from functioning. that is why they have unleashed their evil against options for changes that could strengthen democracy and prevent violence in colombia. brave colombians have been murdered, one by one.  their existence was a threat to the survival of violent practices.  it is not a coincidence that during the current electoral campaign three presidential candidates have been murdered.  it is not a coincidence either that other brave minds that advocated reform had been killed before in that struggle.    rodrigo lara, who was murdered six years on 23 april, was the first to denounce the grave effects of drug trafficking on the stability of our institutions.  those who killed him wanted to open paths for the so-called crime tolerance.    guillermo cano, a brave newsman, represented a free, critical press, such as is needed in a true democracy.  his killers thought that by drowning out his voice they would intimidate the defenders of freedom of speech.    luis carlos galan was killed eight months ago.  by killing him, they sought to assassinate a hope of renovation and change and a deep conviction for the need to radically transform political habits and the climate of corruption, immorality, and indifference in the face of crime.  this indifference led to the emergence of the great evils that are causing bloodshed in the country.    bernardo jaramillo struggled for a peaceful, democratic left that rejected armed struggle and that wanted to build a more just society. by killing him, the criminals sought to block the paths to legitimate protest within the law.    carlos pizarro, the last link in this macabre chain that includes so many others, represented the possibility for guerrilla groups to lay down their weapons and join institutional politics, or for weapons to be replaced by legal instruments to struggle for legitimate ideals. by killing him in a dastardly and cowardly manner yesterday, they sought to destroy the process of reconciliation and reincorporation of armed groups into civil life.    the death of our countrymen should not be in vain.  it strikes deep in our hearts.  it affects the spirit profoundly.  it must, therefore, awaken the national conscience, because those crimes are not merely vile crimes against unarmed great men who believed in the strength of ideals.  these have been crimes against our basic values, against the clean ideals of progress and peace that these men represented.  we must not be mistaken.  those who killed our leaders did not extinguish the noble cause for which they gave their lives.  their values will prevail.  they are our values.  their hopes still live.  those hopes belong to all colombians.  their dream will never disappear.  it is the dream we all have of attaining peace and prosperity.  that is why i praise what antonio navarro said last night: \"i invite the m-19 (19 april movement) to continue walking along the path that pizarro charted.  terrorism's goal has been to close the paths to change, renovation, and reform.    our path, on the contrary, is to make peaceful, democratic revolution viable.  it is a revolution of hope.  this deep crisis will not be solved by restrictions and limitations imposed on the instruments of democracy, but by uniting efforts of all good colombians to repair the roads to change, renovation, and reform. (continued)\n",

      "  communique issued by the general command of the fmln: we announce that between the night of 1 may and the early morning of 2 may, our forces conducted several military operations in san salvador and other cities of the country in response to:    1. the prevailing total impunity of members of the armed forces in violating human rights, as demonstrated by the standstill reached in the trial, the evident cover up of the masterminds of the assassination of the jesuit priests, the release of the group of kidnappers, and the recent murder of a university professor and a cooperative leader.    2.  the military offensive launched by the armed forces in rural areas with indiscriminate bombings and arrests of civilians.    3.  the arrogant and boastful attitude of the government and the military because of an alleged weakness shown by the fmln, which obstructs the negotiation process.    4.  the unpopular economic measures and the plans to carry out the biggest economic fraud and act of corruption in our country's history with the privatization of banks.    we believe that:    1.  the u.s. congressional plan to cut only 50 percent of the military assistance to the government is not enough.  any assistance to terrorist armed forces only contributes to war and reduces the possibility for a short-term cease-fire agreement.    2.  as long as there are no guarantees for the entire society, as long as crimes committed by the military go unpunished, and as long as repression does not stop, war will continue.    finally we reiterate our willingness to continue the negotiation process.  consequently, we have already presented our positions to the government and are awaiting its reply so that we can start holding the negotiations.

      "  san salvador domestic service in spanish at 1808 gmt on 3 may begins to broadcast live a news conference with salvadoran president alfredo cristiani from the presidential house in san salvador.    cristiani begins by saying that the government is looking to put together a viable agenda for its upcoming meeting with the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) so that some headway can be made in the talks.  he adds: \"from what we can foresee, we hope the direct meetings will begin in a week and a half, or somewhere around there.  that is when we think they could start....  in general terms, we do believe progress will be made and that we will advance quite rapidly.\"    in response to a question regarding a letter from an unnamed group of young military officers advocating a purge of the military and supporting criticisms made by former army colonel sigifredo ochoa perez, cristiani says: \"i have never believed anonymous letters or notes.  the fact that it is anonymous casts some doubt on the intentions behind it or about the group that could be sending it. posing as young officers is easy to do.  this could have come from the fmln -- making an issue of all that they have been talking about -- or from any other group.\"    regarding the fmln communique on the rebels' recent military offensive, he states: \"i read the communique and i honestly believe that it is one of the most ridiculous fmln communiques i have seen to date....  i feel that this was a way to seek notoriety through the news.  this could be one of the reasons.  the other reason could be that they are having problems among themselves....  some of them view the dialogue as something serious while others do not, and it could be that these problems are resulting in these irrational adventures by the fmln.\"    turning to recent u.s. government criticism charging slowness in the handling of the investigation and prosecution of those involved in the jesuit murder case, cristiani says: \"as chief executive, i cannot speed up, slow down, or alter the judge's decisions.  in no democracy can the chief executive dictate orders to the judicial branch.  the same happens in the united states as in any other democratic country. i believe that as far as we have been able to see -- although there is much urgency in seeing this trial completed; there are great expectations -- that the judge is duty bound to continue with the judicial procedures stipulated by salvadoran law.\"  he points out that the prosecution of general noriega in the united states is also taking a long time.    regarding a reported fmln attack on his residence in san salvador yesterday, cristiani says: \"i do not know who the person was who reported an attack on the presidential residence, either the official or the private one.  neither of them was attacked, though there could have been some information that such an attack was expected.  an fmln column was dispersed in areas close to the two residences.\"    questioned about the effects on the government of a possible cut in u.s. government aid to el salvador, cristiani responds:  \"well, i think that first of all, the effects of a reduction or cut of aid would be twofold. first, i think it would be a negative signal for the fmln and for the objective of trying to find an end to the conflict through the dialogue process that has been started; and that a cut in aid might be analyzed by some of the members, or all the members of the fmln, as meaning a weakening of the government and its defense and that, therefore, their military victory is now closer.  and it would make it a lot more difficult to end the conflict in a short while through a political dialogue.  second, obviously the government has the responsibility to defend the institutions, the democratic institutions of the country, and will not standby with a weakened defense.  therefore, this means reallocating resources that might be used for other types of programs -- social programs, economic or political programs -- ...  for defense purposes.\"    returning the jesuits murder case, cristiani is asked if the military high command is being investigated.  he says:  \"first of all i would say that the high command -- and this is just my own point of view -- was instrumental in making it possible to carry out the investigation.  the high command made it possible for the investigation to be within the armed forces, an investigation that has no precedent in the past with respect to investigating military units....  it would be very difficult to believe that by supporting the investigation and opening up the armed forces so that they can be investigated in this case, they would have done so if there were some involvement on their part.\"    further as available.\n",

      "  the police confirmed today that presidential candidate alberto fujimori escaped a dynamite attack perpetrated by a shining path cell on 6 may.  according to the police, the dynamite charge was detonated on the route followed by fujimori's motorcade in the district capital of san juan de lurigancho.    the attackers left fliers identifying themselves as members of the movement for the people's defense, a shining path front organization. dora vilchez, a 26-year-old woman, was injured in the attack.    fujimori, who will contend with writer mario vargas llosa in a runoff election during the first half of june, was only informed of the attack by his aides after the police had tightened their security around him.  the \"change 90\" leader minimized the attack and continued his scheduled activities.    the police said that a shining path group managed to infiltrate a crowd of demonstrators and set off the dynamite charge on the route followed by fujimori's motorcade, near a local market, on the eastern side of lima.    vilchez, who was seriously injured, was hospitalized.    the bomb squad unit (ude) defused another explosive device near the market.    the fliers disseminated by the terrorists urged the people not to vote in the runoff election.  one of the fliers said: \"neither fujimori nor vargas llosa is the solution because they both represent the right wing.  long live the armed struggle.  pcp.sl.\"  expansion unknown\n",

      "  the peruvian police, and parts of the army, have received orders of \"strict confinement to barracks\" in view of the 17 may anniversary of the terrorist organization shining path.  the organization has announced it will celebrate its 10th anniversary with an increase in armed operations.    peruvian authorities have discovered that the group that rebelled on 17 may 1980 has devised \"a celebrations plan\" and that it intends to implement the plan as \"a sign of victory\" in the \"struggle of movements,\" an ideology inspired in mao zedong's doctrine.    army personnel have been confined to barracks since the night of 12 may and have already participated on joint operations with the police to arrest 500 alleged terrorists.    in lima, 8,000 police agents and a special antiexplosives squad launched \"a gigantic operation\" of \"blockades and saturation.\"    a police spokesman told efe that they had orders \"to carefully comb the new urban areas and search for suspected criminals, arms, explosives, or subversive material.\"    according to the spokesman, the lima police department headed by general osvaldo diaz has orders \"to watch roads entering the city, to install emergency check points in strategic locations, and to report on anything unusual.\"    according to official sources, the operation will continue until after the runoff election, which is expected to be held on 10 june.    the police have launched similar operations in regions where guerrilla activity is rampant such as ayacucho, puno, huancayo, and huancavelica in the peruvian central highlands.  these regions are all under states of emergency and under military control.    shining path, considered one of the most impenetrable and orthodox armed movements in latin america, began celebrating its anniversary in lima last week by burning 11 state transport company buses. the buses were attacked by hooded individuals thought to be shining path militants.    on 11 may a bomb destroyed a building owned by the family of the mayor of lima.  in another incident in lima today, police corporal oswaldo palomino, who served in ayacucho until a short time ago, was shot to death.    in ayacucho, where the the comunist party of peru -- \"official\" name of shining path -- was born and developed, two people were murdered, and various home-made bombs exploded in in the last 24 hours.    councilmen juan manuel garabito from piura, 1,100 km north of lima, has also been shot to death. authorities blamed shining path for these attacks.    observers of the peruvian guerrilla movement told efe that the growing tide of violence attibuted to shining path indicates that the radical, or \"red\" sector, of the rebel group has taken control of the organization.    according to the sources, two different factions within the organization clashed over the celebration of the group's anniversary: the younger and radical sectors favored purely military operations while the older sector, or \"blacks,\" favored more political and historic activities.    shining path, which officially operates with approximately 5,000 armed men, has caused the death of 20,000 people, including 7,000 civilians, and it is responsible for $17 billion in direct damages to the country over its 10 year history.\n",

      "  terrorist actions were reported tonight south of guatemala city, a few hours after a mass transit bus and several tires were burned in other parts of the city. two explosions took place in a vacant lot at approximately 2120 on 15th avenue and 6th street, zone 13.  according to persons who were nearby at that time, shooting was heard before the explosions. a few minutes later, devices, believed to be fragmentation grenades, went off.  the shock wave created by the blast shattered the windows of house number 729 and building 626, located in front of the vacant lot.  the explosion prompted the quick mobilization of firemen, policemen, and several army armored personnel carriers from la aurora military base.    several members of the special orange explosive squad (unidad naranja especial de lucha antiexplosivos) also arrived to defuse another device left in the area.  at first, it was reported that the home close to the site of the explosion belongedto newsman alvaro contreras velez.  we were not able to verify this report.  we just learned that a family by the name of diaz navarro lives there.  there were no fatalities, but damage to the buildings are reported.    newsman contreras velez, prensa libre editor and author of the \"cacto\" column, came to the area to observe the damage.  it was unofficially established that some government officials live in this sector. municipal firemen helped police authorities in combing the area after the explosions.    the rumor that a car bomb exploded on 7th avenue and 7th street, zone 9, circulated almost simultaneously.  later, it was learned that the explosion was caused by a booby trap.  the authorities are on alert and stepped up operations, a police spokesman said.    again at 2230 tonight, national police explosive experts discovered another device in the vacant lot where two other bombs had gone off earlier.  ten homes were damaged by one of the explosions, including the homes of deputy finances minister gustavo adolfo leiva and guatemala governor mario logorgon.  only material damage was caused. the area residents have been evacuated from the site.  another charge went off in front of the air force's main gate almost at the same time the first bomb went off.  air force officials closed hincapie avenue, from liberacion boulevard to santa fe.  the officers reported material damage and and an exchange of fire in the area nearby.  firemen and policemen and several army armored personnel carriers patrolling the city are maintaning security.\n",
