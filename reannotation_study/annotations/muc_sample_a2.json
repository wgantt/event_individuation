(vides) casanova, salvadorean minister of defence and public security, admitted that the election did not take place in 29 out of 262 districts in the country due to the fact that the army could not restore control over those territories.    apart from motor vehicles with troops and military partols, only taxis with journalists covering the voting drove in san salvador on the election day.  press cars had white handkerchiefs fixed to aerials.  this precaution was taken after military patrols killed three journalists:  robnerto navas, a reuter news photographer, coronel lagrow, a dutch tv correspondent, and mauricio pineda, a staff member of salvadorean television.  luis galdamez, another reuter correspondent, was seriously wounded, and his arm will probably have to be amputated.",

(vargas) i do not know if this is part of a regional or national operation.  all i know is that these are treacherous, cowardly actions, because they are afraid of confronting the soldiers, the 3d infantry brigade military units.  in san miguel, there were five explosions in open areas about 2 to 3 km apart.  there were no casualties or material damage inflicted on the 3d infantry brigade or its installations.  they hit some fuel tanks filled with about 3,000 gallons of gasoline, which started a fire.  however, the fires were in open areas, so there have been no casualties or material damage to the installations.    (sorto) the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) claims it seized el salitre estate and, from there, attacked the 3d infantry brigade.    (vargas) el salitre estate was not occupied.  an old shack on the estate was set ablaze, but the fire department controlled the fire.  i think these are the great revolutionary victories the fmln talks about: attacks against fixed installations that contain no military units, where not even peasants are sleeping at the time.  i believe this is where the fmln says it fights heroically for 4 hours to burn seven patches of crops and how it claims it heroically fights to down power towers, which are unmoving objects.  these are the only great actions it carries out, but these actions are against fixed targets that cannot move.  i repeat, these are cowardly actions that do not confront the soldiers who represent the military abilities of the government and the country.    (sorto) do you have any units combing the area?      (vargas) yes, definitely, we have men in the area.  the truth is that at 0200 today, units were being mobilized.  as i said, these are cowardly actions, carried out in the dark, and the fmln flees when it sees our well-trained men in military uniform.  that is all i have to say.    (sorto) you have permanent guards for san miguel.  some of the market vendors told us for the first time, not a single shot was heard.    (vargas) yes, that is right.  as i said, there have not been any attacks or harassment, just five explosive devices, which does not represent any changes in the correlation of military forces.  the people of san miguel should be calm; we will provide them with security.  the people of the eastern area of the country should be calm, because we will increase our abilities and efforts to provide them with all the security possible.  the fmln will have to pay for being so audacious.    (sorto) the fmln said it was fighting in berlin and alegria.      (vargas) we have no knowledge of any action in berlin and alegria.  we have reports that in san ildefonso, san vicente department -- south of cabanas -- there were problems because the national guard -- which we support throughout the national territory -- reported some catapults had been fired.  however, nothing else happened, and i have no reports of any action in other places.    (sorto) today is mother's day.      (vargas) yes, definitely, greetings to all mothers:  have faith and hope that your sons are here -- from the general to the last soldier -- and they love you very much and are working for you, so you will have the peace and tranquility you need as mothers to generate love and courage for each of your sons.  on behalf of all your sons, the soldiers, to all mothers of the eastern area and of el salvador: receive love and kisses.

(kotov) according to the police, unidentified persons drove up to the soviet embassy building and planted a bomb under a car belonging to one of our diplomatic personnel.  they hardly had time to drive off before an explosion rang out.  one car was totally destroyed and three neighboring vehicles were damaged.  this happened at 2015 local time. and at 2030 hours a volkswagen parked near the entrance of the prc embassy exploded after being packed with dynamite.    fortunately, there are no casualties and no members of the diplomatic missions are hurt.  the buildings are not really damaged.    (bay) so far, according to the information agencies, none of the terrorist groups operating in the country have taken responsibility for this action, although the police suspect the extreme left-wing maoist organization, \"sendero luminoso.\"    (kotov) judging by the hallmark, it could quite well be.  as is well known, \"sendero luminoso\" has carried out several attacks on soviet missions and our citizens in the last 3 years.  many remember the incident when four unidentified people telephoned the soviet embassy -- allegedly to deliver some sort of package.  in the end, one of the terrorists got into the embassy grounds and, at that moment, the \"package\" exploded in his hands.  and several months ago (izvestiya reported this) terrorists planted a bomb under a bus in which soviet fishermen were traveling.    (bay) an extension of the state of emergency in the country has been announced in connection with the escalation in terrorist actions. how does the situation in the country look from where you stand?    (kotov) the state of emergency was introduced here in february 1986 and has been extended virtually every 30-60 days since then.  it is in effect in 35 percent of the country's territory, particularly in lima and the capitals of a number of departments.  however, the wave of terrorism is showing no sign of abating -- either on the part of the far right or the far left.  in october alone, their actions claimed 200 lives.    \"sendero luminoso\" is trying to intimidate the population and wreck the municipal elections planned for 12 november.  they have partially achieved their aim.  to the uninformed, peruvian statistics are simply horrifying: in the last 3 years, 64 mayors of various small and medium-sized towns in the andes have been killed.  naturally, there are few brave enough to take the risk of holding this post.    (bay) what kind of conditions are soviet representatives in peru living and working in?    (kotov) so far there have been no restrictions on our freedom of movement.  however, the escalation of terrorism naturally affects our wellbeing.  people live in a state of tension.  you expect something awful to happen at any moment.  you have to show the maximum caution everywhere: both at home and on the street.",

(lacayo) i cannot say how long it will last.  that is up to the government, and it will depend on the internal situation in the country.  regarding your first question, the situation is difficult. on a military level, the war continues; there is a good deal of misinformation by the salvadoran government and many international news agencies.  the truth is that the battle continues, there has been considerable physical destruction in many towns and neighborhoods on the outskirts of san salvador.  you know which towns are included: zacamil, ciudad delgado, soyapango, etc. this is the result of the indiscriminate bombings by the salvadoran air force.

(reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) i would imagine they are salvadoran rightwing extremists, better known as death squads.  they began to selectively shoot people. there is the case of mrs norma girola de herrera, president of the womens institute, a very progressive institution.  mrs herera was very well known, and she was murdered under circumstances very similar to those of the assasination of the jesuits; on the same day.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo( i do not have any more information because of the city's militarization.  a state of siege has been implemented, the circulation of vehicles is minimal, communication is sparse, telephones are tapped.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) yes, that has been proven.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) they are waging a war which consists at times of maintaining positions, at other times of mobilizing.  on several occasions controlled areas ceased to be controlled but the war continues.

(reporter) colonel, does the president think that during the costa rican meeting enough pressure can be exerted on nicaragua so that it will suspend assistance to the fmln and the war will diminish in the country?    (ponce) the cynicism of the dictator ortega of the sandinist government has been fully proven.  in the previous meetings within the framework of esquipulas ii, he committed himself to discontinuing support for the fmln.  this total war offensive that has been inflicted upon the salvadoran people should be suspended, because we are sure that the moment nicaragua and cuba -- it is through those countries, rather those governments that the communist bloc has been helping the fmln -- the fmln would weaken tremendously.  (sentence as heard)    as a member of the armed forces, as a member of the high command, i feel very proud about the professional, determined, and courageous attitude with which the officers, non-commissioned officers, and troops of our armed forces have neutralized and defeated the fmln offensive.  in this regard, i believe that the opinions voiced by general thurman are not really in line with what we have lived here inside the country.
